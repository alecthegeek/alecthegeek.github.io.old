<a href="http://www.andlinux.org/about.php">andLinux</a>
<blockquote>a complete Linux system designed for developing applications and runs seemlessly in Windows 2000 based systems (2000, XP, 2003)</blockquote>
My new Windows Mobile 5 phone will not sync with Evolution and I am not convinced my WiFi card is working as well as it should.

However I  currently have problems running Windows:
<ol>
	<li>I don't want to because I like Linux and OSS</li>
	<li>Windows is less secure</li>
	<li>Installing <a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/view/HomePage">svk</a> is a pain. It would appear the only option is to install by <a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/view/BuildingFromSourceWithVS2">hand</a> each time there is an upgrade</li>
	<li>I need to run <a href="http://www.gnucash.org/">GnuCash</a> for my accounts</li>
	<li>I have to have access to <a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt">RT</a>, assuming my <a href="http://osdc2007.cgpublisher.com/proposals/23">paper</a> is accepted for OSDC</li>
</ol>
andLinux might represent a practical solution to all the points above except 1 and 2 providing I put with re-building svk each time it gets updated. I've already run GnuCash under <a href="http://colinux.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">coLinux</a> in the past with great success.
