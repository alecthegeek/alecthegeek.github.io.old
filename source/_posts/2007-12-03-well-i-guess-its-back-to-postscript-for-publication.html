<blockquote>Yahoo to put adverts in PDF files</blockquote>
It's not clear from this article how it would work, but my first reaction is that I don't want my documents to have adverts in them and I should consider publishing my documents in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a> instead of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">PDF.</a>

Update: A little research on the <a href="http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=279056">Yahoo</a> web site reveals that PDF publishers have to opt-in, so that's cool (as much as targeting advertising can be).
