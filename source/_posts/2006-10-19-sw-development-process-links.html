The other day someone aske me for some pointers on getting software development processes in place. I did it a bit of a hurry but I was able to come up with this list
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.informit.com/content/images/0321332059/samplechapter/Maraia_ch01.pdf">MS Build Master</a>. Note that this does not address Change Management and is a little simplistic in places.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.swebok.org/ironman/pdf/SWEBOK_Guide_2004.pdf">SWEBOK</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/">Eclipse Process Framework</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/models/">CMMI models</a> and perhaps more usefully a copy of the <a href="http://unicoi.kennesaw.edu/%7Erconn/ase/ase02_01/bookcase/se_sh/cmms/software/hb01.94.pdf">handbook</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=3686090">ITIL</a> is also worth a look for process suggestions â€“ some can be adapted for Development.</li>
</ul>
