At the risk of sounding like a complete fetishist I'm moderately exited to have found a better pen and a cheaper journal.
<h1>First the Pen</h1>
I recently started using the Pilot G2 which is a popular inexpensive gel pen and not too expensive (less than A$5).  Previously I had used Pilot Hi-Tecpoint V7 grip but it tended to bleed through Moleskine pages and leak after flying.

I tend to favour a pen I can afford to buy several of so that it's not a disaster if I lose one (or it get's "borrowed"). Once downside is that the G2 tends to smudge, but apart from that I quite enjoyed using it.  However yesterday I was out with my pocket book and no pen so I had to get a stand in at the local shop -- no G2's on hand, so I picked up at random a Uniball sx210 as a temporary stand-in. It's a similar price but is a rollerball ink pen.

I was so pleased I am going to switch (as soon as offload my G2 supplies onto the rest of the family). The writing action is <strong>much</strong> smoother and the end result
