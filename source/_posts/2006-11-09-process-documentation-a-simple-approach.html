I have been talking about <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/10/27/what-is-a-lightweight-ticket-process/">Lightweight Processes</a> and suggesting that all process must be adequtelty documented.

This got me thinking about easy, lightweight, method to document lightweight process -- in the project Wiki of course. To that end I have started up a small project to create <a href="http://alecclews.pbwiki.com/LightweightProcessDocumenation">Lightweight Process Documenation</a> support.

It will have to wait until I complete some other things, but I am hoping it will easy to create some CSS and a few XHTML tables that can be used to guide the documentation process.

[Update July 2008: I haven't got much done with the CSS etc. However I did post a simple <a title="Example of process documentation" href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2008/07/08/an-easy-way-to-document-process/">example</a> of what it might look like]
