You often see Git <a title="Git Design overview" href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Git#Design" target="_blank">described</a> as a content tracker.Â  The intresting question is "What's so different about that?". The answer was brought home to me the other day.

At $job I have to use a commercial ALM tool, which I shan't name to protect the guilty, that tracks not the contents of file system objects, but their history. This can lead to more merging than necessary, as follows.

Sally and Joan are working on the same code base -- Sally is working on a new feature and Joan is doing <a title="Define BAU" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_as_usual_%28business%29" target="_blank">BAU</a> configuration updates. They of course are both working on separate branches. The workflow is as follows
<ol>
	<li>Joan makes a BAU update and commits it to mainline</li>
	<li>Sally takes the BAU and updates her branch. Normally the changes do not impact any files that Sally is currently working on</li>
	<li>Sally commits to her branch. All the changes from her work area are added into the repo, even the</li>
</ol>
