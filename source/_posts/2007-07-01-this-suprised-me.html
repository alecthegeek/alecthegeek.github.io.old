<a href="http://www.facebook.com/polls.php?poll_id=2430707857&amp;ref=ptns">Facebook | Do you prefer PC or Mac?</a>

People who have no facebook accounts probably can't see this page. In summary, 500 people responded and the ratio was PC 64% and Mac 39%. I can believe that Mac had such a large share, was the sample self-selecting?

Or is there really a shift in the personnel computer market?
