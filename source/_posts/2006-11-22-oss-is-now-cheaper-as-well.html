<a href="http://www.vnunet.com/2168971" target="_blank">This</a> article reports that on low to medium size applicationso OSS databases can be perhaps twice as cost affective as their commercial brethren. There a breif mention of where the current OSS offerings as lacking (system management, XML support).

Considering how complex a modern RDBMS is then this is still considerable eachievment. I look forward to commercial applications, such as <a href="http://serena.com/US/products/dimensions/index.aspx" target="_blank">Serena Dimensions</a>, being shipped on an OSS database in the future
