I need to preface this post by saying that I am neither a lawyer or  an auditor, I am writing an IT consultant and occasionally frustrated  user of other peoples' computers.

There areÂ  conflicting issues I want to  discuss
<ol>
	<li>Increasing demands for corporate governance</li>
	<li>Expectations of doing more with less, adopting lean and agile processes, being responsive to customer needs and following open standards</li>
	<li>A workforce that wants to be engaged, open and flexible</li>
</ol>
Governance

The need to protect the interests of shareholders and the wider community have quite rightly lead to demands that organisations adopt processes to ensure that risk and inappropriate behaviour is minimised. However the way that governance regulations and guidelines are framed, the way they are interpreted and they fashion in which they are implemented often leads to overreaching and inconsistent restrictions on the way IT systems are used. For example, access to LinkedIn and webmail may be blocked to stop the sensitive data from leaking, but users are free to copy files to a USB thumb drive (and often need to for legitimate reasons) -- so why bother stopping access to LinkedIn or GMail for security reasons?

Another underlying assumption of the governance team (and IT support) is that all users have similar needs and skills profiles
