Tiger comes with CUPS installed so:
<ol>
	<li>Enable printer sharing in the System Preferences/Printer Setup tool on the Mac</li>
	<li> At the Mac terminal (Applications/Utilities in Finder) issue the command <code>lpq localhost</code> which will list the name of your CUPS printer queues</li>
	<li>On your  Linux system use the printer administration utility to connect to  the  printer as <code>http://&lt;Mac_IP_Address&gt;:631/printers/&lt;cupsQueueName&gt;</code>, e.g. <code>http://192.168.0.2:631/printers/DESKJET_640C</code></li></ol>
