<ul>
	<li>If in doubt, cut it out. (If you are not sure or clear about something you have written, remove it)</li>
	<li> Assumption is the mother of all cock ups (says it all really)</li>
	<li> The devil is in the detail (You have to drill down to the lowest level as that is where the assumptions and problems lie -- helicopter views are only useful for a short time)</li>
	<li>Bad news don't get a better (Flag issues and problems as early as possible, otherwise it just gets worse)</li>
</ul>
Updated Sept 2010:

And something taught to me by my grandfather, which is <em>not</em> trite:
<ul>
	<li>Measure twice, cut once (Prepare properly and test your assumptions).</li>
</ul>
