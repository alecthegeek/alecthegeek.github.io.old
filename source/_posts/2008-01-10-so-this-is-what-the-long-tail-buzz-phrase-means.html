<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail">The Long Tail - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a> <br /> <blockquote>...describe certain business and economic models such as Amazon.com or Netflix. Businesses with distribution power can sell a greater volume of otherwise hard-to-find items at small volumes than of popular items at large volumes</blockquote><br />I'm probabtly really behnd the times here compared to all you network savvy marketeers, but I was really enlightened by this Wikipedia article explaining one of the big web buzz phrases of the last few years. Whilst I had kinda guessed what it meant it was nice to have my understanding refined and thinking prodded in a new direction.<br /><br />It's just a pity that a lot of these e-tailers have not yet discovered the business opportunities outside the US (we have no NetFlix in Austrailia, many e-bay vendors will not ship out of US, etc etc). I have enjoyed using Amazon for books I could not get locally though.<br /> <br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p>
