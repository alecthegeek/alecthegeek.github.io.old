I will be contributing  some new work at soon at <a href="http://unisolve.com.au/">Unisolve</a> which will revolve around <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/">HTML::Mason</a> and the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo! User Interface Library</a> (YUI). I am really looking forward to digging further into these tools.

Mason is a templating engine for Perl programmers. That means that you can mix Perl code with your data (often HTML) so that additional content can be generated in the fly before the information is presented. For instance you can extract records from a database. There are a plethora of these tools, however Mason is one of the more established.

YUI is a AJAX library designed to allow web applications to present a rich user interface using Javascript (and other stuff) on the browser. This can make web applications provide features and functions that have only be possible previously with "thick" client software that have enough programmed intelligence to support the user interaction experience.
