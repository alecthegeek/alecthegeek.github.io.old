After the dust settled from OSDC what am I doing?
<ol>
	<li>Trying to get some things finished up for my customer</li>
	<li>Thinking about my next contract (hint, hint)</li>
	<li>Migrating to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubunto</a> Linux and upgrading to <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> 2</li>
	<li>Looking to turn my OSDC slides into a more substantial article and add some cool new featurs to the demo (e.g. two way build dependency tracking, reports, integration into <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">cmake</a>,.... solving world hunger)</li>
	<li>Improving my <a href="http://www.vim.org/about.php">Vim</a> work habits: use more macros and scripts for Perl programming; use Vim for XML and HTML editing (including blogging)</li>
	<li>Try and get much better at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Driven_Development">Test Driven Development</a>, more on that in a future post</li>
	<li>Get to bed earlier</li>
	<li>Become better at all the business admin stuff</li>
	<li>Get back on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTD">GTD</a> wagon</li>
	<li>Make posts to my blog at least once every two days</li>
	<li>Get a spell checker working here!</li>
</ol>
Let's see how much sticks?

These are forward looking statements and no commitment should be inferred :-(
