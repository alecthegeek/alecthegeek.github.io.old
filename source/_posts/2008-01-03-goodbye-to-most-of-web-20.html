 <blockquote>Re-evaluating Your Online Commitments</blockquote>
After giving Facebook the flick yesterday, I have just stopped using <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a>, <a href="http://wakoopa.com/">Wakoopa</a> and <a href="http://alecclews.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>. Next I shall start trying to get fewer emails by unsubscribing as much as possible.
