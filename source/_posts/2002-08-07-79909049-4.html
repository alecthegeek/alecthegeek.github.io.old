Another day. Need to get up and at 'em but I just feel like going back to bed. Things to do:

<ul>
<li>Sort out customer training requirments</li>
<li>Prepare for trip to Sydney</li>
<li>Get expaneses done!</li>
<li>Find out about rental situation</li>
<li>Write report for last week</li>
<li>Report time </li>
</ul>

Ahh -- the glammer of the consulting life

The kids seem better this morning, but I guess Jack will still stay home and Marilyn has loads of houses to go and look at :-). Did I mention we are looking for a new house! What a nightmare....
