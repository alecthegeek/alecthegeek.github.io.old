When you work from home there are various things you need to do to look after yourself:
<ol>
	<li>Identify what you need to stay sane and make sure work out how to find or do it</li>
	<li>Set up networks of friends on services such as twitter or facebook. Spend a limited of time each catching up with them -- but be careful not to let it affect productivity too much.</li>
	<li>Make sure you get out off the 'office' for coffee breakfast or lunch. I like to go to a local coffee shop</li>
	<li>Join various groups relevant to your professional or personal interests and consider attending group meetings. IT people based in Melbourne can find a list at <a title="User Groups in Melbourne" href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Melbourne#User_Groups" target="_blank">Perl Net</a></li>
	<li>Set boundaries to help you switch off from work and do something else. Having an private office and defined office hours can help</li>
	<li>Make sure that the people you live with understand when you are work and can't be usually expected to join in other activities</li>
	<li>Be flexible and break the schedule and work practices sometimes. After all flexibility is the main reason to telecommute</li>
</ol>
He also helps to create a decent working environment (space, light, furniture, storage, IT systems). I made some notes on <a title="Notes on working away from the office" href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2007/01/02/things-you-need-when-you-work-away-from-a-corporate-office/" target="_blank">this</a>
