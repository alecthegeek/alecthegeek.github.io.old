This is a presentation I gave a few years ago to the <a title="LUV Web Site" href="http://www.luv.asn.au/" target="_blank">Linux Users of Victoria</a> (Australia) on SCM. It's brief and simplistic, but hopefully will server as a jumping off point if SCM is confusing you. As always feedback is welcome.
