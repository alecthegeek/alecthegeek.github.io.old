<a href="http://angryaussie.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Mr Angry</a> makes some <a href="http://angryaussie.wordpress.com/2006/07/28/mr-angrys-rules-for-employing-contractors/" target="_blank">comments</a> about employing contractors. A few weeks ago I made a presentation at the <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/osdclub/index.html" target="_blank">OSDClub </a>on how to get the greatest benefit from using consultants. i.e. paying project budget for outsides to perform services for you. As it was very much a personal perspective I would be very interested in people's comments, just click the mind map on the left to see the full size version

What was also interesting from this exercise was that I used the mind map, instead of the usual slides, to present my views and the novel format for the material meet with great approval. The mind map was created with <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">FreeMind</a>

The source <a title="Mindmap on GItHub" href="http://github.com/alecthegeek/Presentations/tree/master/HowToGeTheBestBangForYourConsultingDollar/" target="_blank">mindmap</a> for this diagram is on GitHub. You will need a copy of <a title="Freemind Home Page" href="http://www.sf.net/" target="_blank">Freemind</a> (at least Rel 9).
