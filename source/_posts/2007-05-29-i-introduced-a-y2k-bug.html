Some of us actually introduced our own Y2K bug :-(.

In about 1984 I was working in Jordan on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_teller_machine">ATM</a> system implementation. The customer has some very specific requirements with regard to keeping transaction records on the  card magnetic strip. As you you can imagine there is very constrained space on the back of a bank card for information storage, so we stored the date of the last transaction as DDDYY (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal">BCD</a> storage for those that can remember back that far).
