Google Video presentation from<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Schwaber"> Ken Schwaber</a>, one of the founders of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29">Scrum</a>, about the basics of Scrum. Well worth looking at, especially if you come from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">XP</a> background.

Great Quote "Exercise profession competently"

Core messages:
<ul>
	<li>Say <strong>no</strong> to cutting quality -- make product management drop features instead</li>
	<li>It's easy to end up with a design dead product, it takes about 5 years of cutting corners</li>
</ul>
Intresting tit-bit
<ul>
	<li>Drive Architecture and Infrastructure from non-functional requirements</li>
	<li>Scrum was not successful until the advent of high quality IDE's</li>
</ul>
