<blockquote>An independent survey of more than 240 Australian business managers concludes that Generation Y are the most difficult employees to manage.</blockquote>
I attended an internal conference recently where a CIO I work with suggested that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen-y">Gen-Y</a> would present new challenges for management because of their need to be:
<ol>
	<li>Always networked</li>
	<li>Continually stimulated and keep interested</li>
</ol>
This survey would seem to bear this out.

I think I have already seen this affect. Over the last couple of years I have seen recent graduates with delusions of grandeur (in one particular example raw 23 years expecting to be project managers) in terms of job interest. I am pleased to say that after a few weeks of my acid tongue their ego was sufficiently damaged for them to take on more mundane jobs such as documenting and managing the backup cycle.

However I am one of the more continually connected ones. I always have <a href="http://meebo.com/">Meebo</a> open, to get around the IM blocks in the firewall, and use <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> many, many, times a day -- and I only <em>just</em> qualify as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen-X">Gen-X</a>
