I am glad to report that <a title="Voga web site" href="http://voga.com.au" target="_blank">voga.com.au</a> has <em>not</em> been blocked by the great <a title="Internet censorship in China" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China">Firewall of China</a>. Anyone in China who needs assistance with their software process can safely <a title="Ping results for voga.com.au" href="http://www.just-ping.com/mail_ping_output.php?vjob=20080731_1217490623.68" target="_blank">get hold</a> of services and help from your truly. I'm sure the doom mongers are feeling a bit foolish now?
