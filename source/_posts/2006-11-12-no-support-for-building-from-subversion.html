I <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/11/02/subversion-based-software-building/">mentioned</a> a few days ago that I was looking to write a <a href="http://alecclews.pbwiki.com/SubversionBuilding">paper</a> about building from Subversion using strict configuration management control.

There seems to be no previous art on how to do this, even in a similiar way to the current way that GNU Make suppors tools like RCS (admintally RCS is a file based version control system as apposed to directory based like CVS and Subversion).

So I a appear to be breaking new ground :-).

I had an epithany today relating to the use of listing a Build Of Lost as a Subversion repository. Make should be able to update the build revion with the details of the files used as inputs -- the slightly tricky part is to conconcate the information from source files to final built targets via the intermediate built files.

Update 14/Nov/06 -- I did find <a href="http://subversion.open.collab.net/articles/IntegratingSubversionIntoYourAntBuild.html">this</a> about using <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> and Subversion, <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/tasksoverview.html#scm">this</a> list of VC Ant tasks and <a href="http://ant.apache.org/external.html#Source%20Control%20Systems">this</a> list of optional Ant tasks
