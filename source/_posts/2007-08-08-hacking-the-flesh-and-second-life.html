This post is specially for my son Jack.

<a href="http://jon.oxer.com.au//">Jonathon Oxter</a>  has a video on Google showing how to connect the real world (electric lights, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFID">RFID</a> chips embedded in the body etc.) to things in the <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> game
