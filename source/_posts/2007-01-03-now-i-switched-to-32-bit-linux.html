As I <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2007/01/01/i-switched-linux/">mentioned</a> earlier I have just switched to Ubuntu Linux -- however despite early promise there were ongoing problems with Java and Eclipse. In a bit to fix this I have switched to a 32 bit environment.

If this does not work then I think my next option may be to use bloody Windows :-(.

Update 4/Jan

Well that seems much better -- it all seems to work out of the box (Skype, Java, Eclipse, Firefox plugins etc etc) except I have not set up wireless yet.

Update 8/Jan

And now wireless and hybernation work without too much effort.
