<blockquote>ASUS Shows Off 8.9" Eee PC 900</blockquote>
I considered the EEE PC some time ago and decided that it was not really for me because of storage and screen limitations. However the new 900 has a 1024x600 display and 12Gb flash drive. With USB ports for mouse &amp; keyboard and a monitor port plus storage expansion via SD and USB could this become a serious machine?
