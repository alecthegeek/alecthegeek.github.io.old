For undersandable reasons todays product vendors are very concerned to present a business justification for what they sell rather than flogging "toys  for the boys".

However I think this example takes it too far -- I couldn't actually work out what this vendor was offering. Very tempting to click 'next' on the browser? I'm guessing that <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MarketingDroid">marketing droid</a> did Commerce rather than IT...

(This was the total extend of vendor's information on the Sun web page)
