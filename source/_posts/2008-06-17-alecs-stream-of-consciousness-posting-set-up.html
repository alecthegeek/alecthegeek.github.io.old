A long with a lot of  other sad people, I have been throwing my <a title="define " href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stream_of_consciousness" target="_blank">random thoughts</a> onto the <a title="define intertubes" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=intertubes" target="_blank">intertubes</a> in the belief that they are of interest to people. In order to maximise the spread of mental drivel and minimise the effort involved I have spent far more time than I should investigating and setting up (playing with) various services and feeds to spread my 'goddness' far and wide. Here is how it works
<ol>
	<li>I have conversations on <a title="Alec on jaiku" href="http://jaiku.com/alecthegeek" target="_blank">Jaiku</a></li>
	<li>I use <a title="Alec on twitter" href="http://twitter.com/alecthegeek" target="_blank">twitter</a> to hit as many people as possible</li>
	<li><a title="Alec on friendfeed" href="http://friendfeed.com/alecthegeek" target="_blank">Friendfeed</a> allows me to see information from many more people than Jaiku</li>
	<li>ping.fm allows me to post to Jaiku, Twitter and facebook</li>
	<li>ping.fm also posts pownce, tumblre, plurk, Identi.ca and myspace but that's probably a waste of time although I do have a limited number of followers there</li>
	<li>I do not post to LinkedIn as sometimes my comments are not that professional :-)</li>
	<li>Both Jaiku and Friendfeed also receive feeds from my Wordpress blog, my Flikr photos, del.ico.us book marks and my dugg stories</li>
</ol>
So I monitor friendfeed for the 'big picture', post to ping.fm and watch jaiku for interesting conversations.
