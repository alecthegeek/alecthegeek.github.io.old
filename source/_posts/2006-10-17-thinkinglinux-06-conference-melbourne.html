A few days ago I was a little <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/10/10/off-to-a-conference/">sniffy</a> about the <a href="http://www.thinkinglinux.com.au/ThinkingLinux/">ThinkingLinux</a> conference, to which I had <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wangle">wangled</a> a free ticket just by being in the first twenty to telephone a number in an newspaper ad. Having attended today I have to say it was very useful and well worth going to; it was admittedly a vendor event, as opposed to an industry conference, but still worth going to - if you booked before 2/Oct it was only A$99 anyway.

I shall be posting some more details over the next few days but here is my high level brain dump:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://dev.alfresco.com/">Alfreso</a> supports document management, embedded processes, version control etc. It can be used from Windows clients using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mind/1196/cifs.asp">CIFS</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.pentaho.com/">Pentaho</a> has some neat data mining and dashboard technology. Compare to <a href="http://www.businessobjects.com/products/businessobjectsxi/default.asp?intcmp=hp_products2">BusinessObjects</a>.</li>
	<li>For software development process (a subject dear to my heart) consider <a href="http://scrumwiki.org/">ScrumWiki</a> (I wonder if there is an Extreme Programming WiKi?)</li>
	<li>Eclipse have just released version 1.0 of their <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/">Process Framework</a>, which includes the Open Unified Process (head for the hills!) and EPF composer so you can customise your own processes which sounds much more useful. Currently the composer creates web pages that document the process, there is no process automation engine, whatever you might guess that to be.</li>
	<li><a href="http://twiki.org/">TWiki</a> might be highly configurable</li>
	<li><a href="http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/">BackupPC</a> is a neat way to backup Linux and Windows machines across a network. Minimises back up sets and it's easy to restore (files copies from a web browser)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> can be used, not just to receive status messages, but also to send commands to software agents</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/xen/">XEN</a> is a sophisticated piece of server management technology for failover and server migration. I'm going to use it on my laptop for development.</li>
	<li>The award for the coolest acronym must be <a href="http://linux-ha.org/STONITH">STONITH</a></li>
</ul>
