<ul>
	<li>When setting up source dependencies it is necessary to use the
full
workset path from the workset root</li>
	<li>When the JAR task looks for class files it
<ul>
	<li>Looks by default in the directory as the Java source file</li>
	<li>Looks for classes to jar called *.jar</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>If the source directory contains code that is used by more than
jar file then the jar file will contain more classes than it should</li>
	<li>If an intermediate directory is used to split this
up then the jar task still seems to insist on jar from the source
directory, not the intermediate directory</li>
	<li>This can be mitigated by using the the ModuleDir flag on the Java
Jar task
<ul>
	<li>or use the alternative ‘Filter Java
Classes by Name’</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>If any task has to be removed then it is necessary
to delete the TGT and start again. This is fixed in Build 6.2</li>
	<li>TGT files must not have the option "Don't force new
revision number on check in' on (contributed by Ben Hui)</li>
	<li>A more sophistigated ordering of command execution can be
echieved by splitting up a TGT file into multiple TGT files. Then make
the downstream targets depend on the intermediate targets .e.g. class
files or javac internal Openamake files</li>
	<li>Search· Paths
<ul>
	<li>Must contain '.' which should be the first directory, i.e. the
current build directory</li>
	<li>Should not contain sub directories of the current build
directory for source depdendencies</li>
	<li>Must contain sub directores of the current build diretcory if
those dirs contain intermediate targets, or final tragets that are
re-used</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Only use search paths to identify differences between various
build
levels ??</li>
	<li>Windows Cut and paste works in the Openmake GUI client with
Ctrl-V and Crtrl-C</li>
	<li>How to test builds from the command line. Run <code>bldmake
"PROJECTNAME" "SEARCHPATHNAME" -a -ov &amp;&amp; om -pv -f Java.mak -ov</code></li>
	<li>Having multiple TGT files in a workset (contributed by Vadym
Krevs):
<ul> usually the source code for a project lives in one workset.
Here by "project" I mean a totally generic software project (or a
version of software component) - without any connection to Openmake or
Dimensions project. For example, we use one workset PVCS:DM8040 for the
"Dimensions 8.0.4.0" project, and another workset PVCS:DM9000 for the
"Dimensions 9.0.0.0" project and so on. Within each such "project" we
have many buildable targets such as dmlsnr, dmappsrv, dmcli,
libpcmscore.so, etc. It is just simpler to manage project source code
if it lives in one workset.Now, going back to Openmake, one TGT file can only be used to define
one buildable target like dmlsnr or libpcmscore.so. In any non-trivial
project - like yours, most likely, you'd have many targets, hence the
need to have one TGT file per each such target in the project workset.
In other words, you want to have all project's TGTs within one workset,
so that when that workset is reflected in one or more build areas which
constitute a search path, Openmake could build more than one target in
one go. Does that answer your question about why would one have more
than one TGT in a workset?As to whether it makes sense to associate a workset with more than one
Dimensions build projects, the answer is no, and probably you will not
be able to do that. If you can, then it is a bug.Remember that a "build project" defined via DBPROJ/Adminconsole in
Dimensions corresponds to an Openmake project, whereas a "project"
defined via DPROJ/Adminconsole represents a version of your build
project. All build-related commands in Dimensions operate with respect
to a project, not a build project. All search paths defined in Openmake
for use with Dimensions reference projects, not build projects. When
you set up build, you select a "development" workset and associate it
with a project via DWS/SWS, not a build project. Whenever BLD/BLDB look
for target definitions to be built, they automatically restrict the
list of candidate TGT in the workset to the list of such TGTs which
reference the build project that corresponds to the project assigned to
your development workset. Thus, if you have TGTs defined for different
build project within one workset, then TGTs defined for the "foreign"
build project will simply be ignored.</ul>
</li>
	<li>When using Dimensions Build on remote UNIX nodes then is is
neccassry to set up environment varibales (usually used in search
paths, e.g. JAVA_HOME) as follows (contributed by Vadym Krevs):</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Become root and shutdown the Dimensions listener on the remote
UNIX node via "<code>. &lt;DM_ROOT&gt;/dprofile; stop_dimensions -force</code>",
and verify that no dmlsnr and/or dmlibsrv processes are running on that
remote UNIX node (<code>ps -ef | grep dm[lai]</code>).</li>
	<li>Change to $DM_ROOT/prog, rename dmlibsrv into dmlibsrv.real
<ol> <big>·<code>cd $DM_ROOT/prog; mv dmlibsrv dmlibsrv.real;
ls
-alF $DM_ROOT/prog/dmlibsrv.real</code> </big></ol>
</li>
	<li>Create a shell script named "dmlibsrv" in $DM_ROOT/prog with the
following contents. You can set any number of environment variables
before the last line which spawns dmlibsrv process - which is the
process launching bldmake and om executables.
<ol> <big> <code>#!/bin/sh</code></big><code><big>. &lt;your DM_ROOT&gt;/dmprofile</big></code><code><big>export JAVA_HOME=&lt;your path to Java&gt;</big></code><code><big>export
OPENMAKE_SERVER=http://&lt;somehostname&gt;:58080/openmake</big></code><code><big>export PERLLIB=&lt;your perl library search path
value&gt;
export
PATH=&lt;your path to bldmake &amp; om&gt;:&lt;path to perl
5.6.x&gt;:&lt;path to Java&gt;:$PATH # On AIX use LIBPATH, on HP-UX use
SHLIB_PATH, on other systems use LD_LIBRARY_PATH export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&lt;your path to bldmake &amp; om&gt;:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export REFDIR=&lt;your examples location&gt; # # Add any additional
environment variables to customize the environment #</big></code>

<code><big>&lt;your DM_ROOT&gt;/prog/dmlibsrv.real $*·
1&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</big></code><big> </big></ol>
</li>
	<li>Ensure that the created shell script is owned by the DM_OWNER
user (typically dmsys, check the value of DM_OWNER in dmgvar.sh) and
that it is executable:
<ol> <big> <code>chown dmsys:dmtool $DM_ROOT/prog/dmlibsrv ; chmod 555
$DM_ROOT/prog/dmlibsrv</code> </big></ol>
</li>
	<li>Restart the Dimensions listener via "<code>dmlsnr -param
$DM_ROOT/dfs/listener.dat</code>".·</li>
	<li>Try submitting a build job against that remote UNIX node. Now
bldmake and om will have their environment initialized correctly.</li>
</ol>
