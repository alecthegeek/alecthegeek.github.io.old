It’s often useful to run a POP3/SMTP server on your system to demo/test/use the email functions when using applications. Apache James is the only free option I have come across so far – here are some installation notes to help get you started on Windows (but remember YMMV):
<ol>
	<li>Download from the <a href="http://james.apache.org/">James</a> website</li>
	<li>Make sure you have admin privilege</li>
	<li>Unpack the James archive into an empty directory. I would chose not to have spaces in the directory path, although no longer seem cause problems</li>
	<li>Make sure no other SMTP or POP3 servers (or NNTP) are running</li>
	<li>In a command prompt change to the installation directory and run <code>bin/run.bat</code></li>
	<li>Hit control-C to stop James running</li>
	<li>Mkae sure you know the address of your DNS server</li>
	<li>You are now probably in the bin directory, so run the command '<code>cd ..</code>'</li>
	<li>Edit the file apps\james\SAR-INF\config.xml. Change any ports you need to (I would suggest POP3 and SMTP) and disable the NNTP server. Make sure you use the correct value fo the &lt;dnsserver&gt; entry (more details on the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/james/JamesQuickstart">Quick Start</a> guide). You may also want to change the default admin account credentials. You will need to use a proper editor (e.g. <a href="http://vim.org/">Vim</a>) as this file is in UNIX format.</li>
	<li>In a command prompt run <code>bin/run.bat</code></li>
	<li>In another command prompt windows run a telnet session as follows <code>telnet localhost 4555<code></code></code></li>
	<li>Login with the James admin credentials (default is root/root)</li>
	<li>Issue the command <code>adduser &lt;userid&gt; &lt;password&gt;</code> (use the command <code>quit</code> when finished)</li>
	<li>Configure an email client to talk to James using the correct port settings and user credentials</li>
	<li>Send yourself a test email</li>
	<li>Hit control-C to stop James running</li>
	<li><code>cd bin</code></li>
	<li>Run the command <code>wrapper -i ..\conf\wrapper.conf</code></li>
	<li>Run the command <code>net start "James 2.3.0"</code>(or whatever version number was installed)</li>
</ol>
