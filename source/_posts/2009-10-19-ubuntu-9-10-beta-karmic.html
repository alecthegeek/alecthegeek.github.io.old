I have just installed Ubuntu Netbook Remix 9.10 <a title="Karmic Beta" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/karmic/beta" target="_blank">beta</a> on my EEEPC 100H and so far it's been a great experience. Things that work better out of the box
<ul>
	<li>Synaptic touch pad</li>
	<li>LCD Fonts</li>
	<li>Remix user interface</li>
	<li>Network printing</li>
	<li>Performance</li>
	<li>Suspend/Resume</li>
	<li>Bluetooth device setup</li>
	<li>I also have reason to believe that the sound works better in Skype, but I'm still kicking the tyres on that</li>
</ul>
Improved Applications:
<ul>
	<li>GNOME Evolution now works well on the smaller screen</li>
	<li>Gwibber is much more useful for microblogging but it needs some work on reliability and performance</li>
	<li>Eclipse 3.5 now installs out of the box</li>
	<li>BOUML is now up to date</li>
</ul>
A few odd things that it would be nice to see fixed
<ul>
	<li>Evolution sometimes looses it Window border. Something to do with the Remix window manager I think</li>
	<li>Some things I had to try a second time before they settled down. E.g. 3G network management, bluetooth mouse setup (but that was probably finger trouble on my part), Skype sound</li>
</ul>
All in all a great release. I love it!
