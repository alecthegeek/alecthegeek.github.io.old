<br /><br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7299875.stm">BBC NEWS | Technology | Web creator rejects net tracking</a> <br /> <blockquote>a warning for young people about putting personal data on these sites. <p> "Imagine that everything you are typing is being read by the person you are applying to for your first job. Imagine that it's all going to be seen by your parents and your grandparents and your grandchildren as well."</p></blockquote><br />I'm putting this here mainly for the benefit of my son, although he is very responsible online. Hopefully it will be a useful reminder for everyone else as well, including me.<br /><br />Thanks to my father for sending me the link.
