<blockquote>I have always liked having my laptop BIOS boot password on</blockquote>
After my last post <a href="http://davehall.com.au/blog/dave" target="_blank">Dave Hall</a> made some excellent points on the shortcomings of BIOS passwords (which in this instance did not not bother me too much) and also made a reference to disk encryption. I've thought about the idea of disk encryption for some time(if you run Windows or OS/X I'm not sure what options you have) but I've always been concerned about arousing the suspicion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration" target="_blank">TSA</a> when travelling to the US; plus I never has the correct install DVD with me when I was re-installing my Ubuntu GNU/Linux system.

By a strange coincidence a few days after Dave's comment I managed to corrupt my hard disk partition and decided to implement disk encryption as part of the re-install. So whilst waiting to verify my backups I downloaded the Ubuntu 9.04 Alternative ISO. When installing Ubuntu it's a simple matter of selecting yes to disk encryption and entering a pass phrase.

After the installation was complete Ubunto now prompts me for my pass phrase at boot time, so I switched off the BIOS password.

<em>N.B. Implementing this has required me to make a policy decision that I will freely disclose my pass phrase to any legal request from law enforcement authorities wherever I may be.</em>

I'm delighted to say that I have noticed NO performance penalty after implementing this.
