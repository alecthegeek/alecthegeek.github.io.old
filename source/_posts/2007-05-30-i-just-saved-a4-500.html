Over the last few weeks I have been suffering from a serious case of <a href="http://macuser.thepodcastnetwork.com/2006/09/14/woz-speaks-on-mac-lust/">Mac lust</a>. However a quick <a href="http://mail.pm.org/pipermail/melbourne-pm/2007-May/002339.html">enquiry</a> on the local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Mongers">Perl Mongers</a>  list elicited a few pithy words, from less giddy heads than mine, showing that I should give myself a good slap and be happy with my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%28Linux_distribution%29">Ubuntu</a> system (which is superior in many ways).

Thanks Guys and Gals!
