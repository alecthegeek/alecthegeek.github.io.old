<blockquote>issues with this type of online social networking</blockquote>
It's actually more than a year since I first blogged about social networking and the world of web 2.0. The web, and the practices that surround it, have moved on so I thought I update my thoughts as well. By a strange coincidence, just as I was starting this post I came across <a href="http://crazeegeekchick.com/" target="_blank">crazeegeekchick</a>'s thoughts on how to <a href="http://crazeegeekchick.com/blog/how-i-use-social-networking/" target="_blank">use social networking</a> -- well worth reading before you carry on.

Generally social networking has been a huge consumer of my attention and time; and to be honest I don't think the medium given me a very good return on my investment, except as a learning exercise.
<ol>
	<li><a title="LinkedIn website" href="http://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> has become an online list of business contacts. But of limited use because I can't add my own notes to profiles. I have had some networking activity -- but to be honest it has not made a huge amount of difference to my working life. I think now the number of people on the service is becoming so large anyway that it's becoming less useful, but I hope I'm wrong
Updated 13/Nov/08 -- You can now add notes to your LinkedIn contacts</li>
	<li>Facebook has become pretty pointless. I don't have time to become a zombie and most of the other stuff I do use is not terribly useful. e.g. I just became a facebook fan of <a title="Gordon Ramsay facebook fan page" href="http://www.new.facebook.com/pages/Gordon-James-Ramsay/17311958033?ref=mf" target="_blank">Gordon Ramsay</a> -- but so what? Nothing happens much.</li>
	<li>Blogging gives me a certain amount of satisfaction and I often refer back to my old blog posts for information. I also know that a few people have found help from ramblings so I count the blog as a success. However it's rare for me to get over 100 readers a day so it's not a huge success</li>
	<li>Lifestream (twitter, jaiku,identi.ca). This is very distracting and I need to find some way to stop keep looking at my friendfeed stream. However on the positive side it does provide me some of the support that I miss being a solo worker. It's probably a good idea to whittle down my 'posse' to as few as 10 people to reduce the noise; question is which 10 -- I'm generally pretty choosy who I "friend". <a title="Pro Blogger's twitter feed" href="http://www.twitter.com/problogger" target="_blank">Problogger</a> has a <a title="Twitter Tips for Beginners" href="http://www.twitip.com/" target="_blank">site</a> introducing Twitter, and by extension most of the other micro blogging site, and Silkcharm also posted some <a title="New on Twitter? Tips and Hints" href="http://silkcharm.blogspot.com/2008/10/new-on-twitter-tips-and-hints.html" target="_blank">suggestions</a></li>
	<li>Geo Location (e.g. brightkite, dopplr). I am just so over that. In Australia it's hard to use anyway because we have limited network coverage and I don't have an iPhone. I keep thinking they a potentially huge personal security issue as well</li>
	<li>I have accounts on delicious and flickr which I find useful. Delicious in particular has proved very <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2007/06/28/my-favourite-delicious-tip/" target="_blank">useful</a> professionally and personally.</li>
</ol>
As I mentioned earlier the major upside is that I now think know a lot more than the general population about this stuff -- perhaps I can become a media pundit? Easier than doing real work, talking of which...
