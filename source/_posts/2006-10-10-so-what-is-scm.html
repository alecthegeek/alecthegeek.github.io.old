My favourite <a href="http://www.cmcrossroads.com/bradapp/acme/scm-defs.html#Dart">SCM Definition</a>. <em> Yes I know it's dull and boring, but I've been in CM for 8 years dammit! I can't help it.</em>

I often add the following personal observations:
<ul>
	<li>Identification also allows us to answer such meta questions as:
<ol>
	<li>Which larger sub-system is this item a part of?</li>
	<li>What is this item's purpose?</li>
	<li>How is this item related to other items and sub systems?</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Change Control allows  us to partition work into change sets or tasks, which we can use to track progress as well as control our releases</li>
	<li>Accounting allows us to answer questions about the work that is currently happening and gives us visibility into the process as things happen, or soon afterwards</li>
	<li>Auditing allows to re-assure our customer, and ourselves, that we fulfilled the contract correctly in the manner we promised</li>
</ul>
