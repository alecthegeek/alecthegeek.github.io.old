I'm up at the Sydney Gartner <a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/sym/2006_/ps14/ps14_home.jsp">conference</a> where I heard an interesting presentation from <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/katecarruthers">Kate Carruthers</a> from <a href="http://westfield.com">Westfield</a> about IT outsourcing. Kate's main message was to concentrate on the basics.
<ul>
	<li>People (culture, training, support)</li>
	<li>Process (approriate and good enough, matched across boundaries, project and requirements managment)</li>
	<li>Platforms (systems, applications, architecture, tools)</li>
</ul>
