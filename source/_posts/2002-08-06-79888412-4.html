At last got <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> 1.0.7 to compile under <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</a> and it even seems to work -- but arhhhhh, I can't get the damm thing to work with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> <a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org/">Enigmail,</a>, which is where I need to be. (Mozilla is now ready for prime time -- it has a <a href="http://spellchecker.mozdev.org/">spell checker</a>!!)

Must get some sleep and put trash out and get kids on loo for late night pee

Good night!
