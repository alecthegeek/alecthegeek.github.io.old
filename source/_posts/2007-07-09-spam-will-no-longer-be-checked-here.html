Ever since I migrated to  Wordpress (about 12 months now) I've been reviewing spam comments to make sure there were no false positives. Out of over 3,200 pieces of spam there were three flagged in error by <a href="http://akismet.com/">Askimet</a> and none at all in the last few months.

So from now on I am no longer going to check the spam queue. If your post does not show up straight away  then you will have to email me (it's easy to find my address) to get me to check the  spam queue for your comment.
