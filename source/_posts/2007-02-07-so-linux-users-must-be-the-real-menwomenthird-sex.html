<blockquote>Macs are glorified Fisher-Price activity centres for adults; computers for scaredy cats too nervous to learn how proper computers work; computers for people who earnestly believe in feng shui.</blockquote>
Fabulous  op piece from Charlie Brooker describing why Mac users are a bunch of <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wallies">wallies</a> who can't use real computers. Makes me feel all smug about using Linux, although I have lots of Mac using Geek friends who are definitely not wallies.

Mind you if it's a choice between Windows and OS/X I think I'll "take a Mac please Bob".

And I know lots of you don't have a choice and are stuck on Blue-Screen-of-Death-Ville.
