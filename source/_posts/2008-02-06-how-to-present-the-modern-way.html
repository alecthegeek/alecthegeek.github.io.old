Another presentation by <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/">Paul Fenwick</a>, this time a lightning talk on Greasemonkey that was awarded best lightning talk at LAC last month. What is intresting is the presentation style, which we are starting to see a lot more at conferences. It makes a refreshing change from <a href="http://www.thinkoutsidetheslide.com/articles/avoid_death_by_ppt.htm">death byÂ  Powerpoint</a>
