Update 1/Jan/08 -- material can now be found at http://github.com/alecclews/svnbuilding/tree/master

I <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/11/02/subversion-based-software-building/">mentioned</a> some time ago that  I was writing a paper about building software under configuration managemenet control. I've posted the slides below that I presented at <a href="http://osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a> today, plus the example driver script and makefile can be download from <a title="SVN Building project on github" href="http://github.com/alecclews/svnbuilding/tree/master" target="_blank">Github</a>.

I still hope to provide a full paper with more detail later. In the meantime please feel to use and provide feedback.
