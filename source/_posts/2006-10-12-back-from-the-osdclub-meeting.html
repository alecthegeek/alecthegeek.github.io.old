Well I just got back from the local <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/osdclub/index.html">Open Source Developers</a>, a group who meet once every couple of months to discuss issues of interest to the community.

This week we had Simon Taylor from <a href="http://www.unisolve.com.au/">Unisolve</a> talking about <a href="http://psr.rice.edu/sed.html">sed</a> and I talked about what  it's like working in an OSS startup (pretty exiting mostly and pretty scary sometimes -- but never dull). Simon discussed some advanced uses for sed and showed some hairy examples -- lots of fun and it reminded that perhaps I should not dust off <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Perl">perl</a> quite so often and use sed instead. Thanks Simon.
