Often developers get a limited choice on the Version Control (VC) or Software Configuration management tool they have to use when working on a project. However even when the Git (the Distributed Version Control tool) does not interface with the project tool there is value in using Git for a personal workflow. This can work as follows.
<ol>
	<li>Fetch a copy of the working code needed to make your change</li>
	<li>Initialise a new Git repo in your working copy and add the code</li>
	<li>Now checkout a new git branch for your work</li>
	<li>hack hack hack test test....</li>
	<li>Commit</li>
	<li>Switch to master branch</li>
	<li>Fetch from the project tool again.</li>
	<li>Add changes and commit</li>
	<li>Review differences, rebase or merge as required.</li>
	<li>Verify project tool still at same state from step 7</li>
	<li>Upload/ check in changes to project tool. You can use the output from git log as the basis of your commit message for the legacy tool</li>
</ol>
Rinse and repeat
