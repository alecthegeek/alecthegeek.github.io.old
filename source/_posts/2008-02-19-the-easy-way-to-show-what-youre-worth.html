<blockquote>"Ensure people know your value"</blockquote>
This often quoted phrase is rarley followed up with anything except generalisations. The easy way to show everyone how valuable you are is to write a simple weekly email for your manager (and anyone involved in your current projects). It should have four main headings:
<ul>
	<li>Issues for attention - anything that might need action by others or that poses a risk</li>
	<li>Progress since the last report</li>
	<li>Planned activity for the next report period</li>
	<li>Further information - Details or notes that don't fit elsewhere (optional).</li>
</ul>
The secret is to keep this very brief, a series of one line bullet points is best. However you end up with paper audit trail of your working life and help make your boss' life easier.
