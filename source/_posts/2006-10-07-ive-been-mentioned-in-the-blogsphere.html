My good friend and colleague <a href="http://headwestsimon.wordpress.com/">Simon</a> has started writing and mentions me in his first <a href="http://headwestsimon.wordpress.com/2006/10/06/how-far-have-you-come-2/">post</a>.

Of course it's been a long trip for him to move from Singapore to US. I am still enjoying the sunshine here in Australia
