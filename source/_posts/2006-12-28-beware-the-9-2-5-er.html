<blockquote cite="http://www.agilemanagement.net/Articles/Weblog/blog.html">So, (first question) are project managers a different breed? Are they motivated by extrinsic incentives (like salesmen) when all the management science literature tells us that knowledge workers are motivated intrinsically (I never have been sure I believed all that science but we hear it repeated often enough from many in the agile community)?</blockquote>

I was reading a post about project managers when this phrase <span>leapt</span> out and bashed me over the head, only where the author wrote "project manager" I saw "developers-who-don't-give-dam". It is an unfortunate fact of life that many developers display a 9 to 5, this-is-just-my-job, attitude (9-2-5-<span>ers</span>) that is at odds to the 'I want to always do things better and learn' approach required to be a member of a successful Agile team.

There are several reasons why this attitude <span>creates</span> a problem:

<!--more-->
<ol>
	<li>No refactoring done</li>
	<li>No effort to try and improve the team process and work smarter</li>
	<li>No ownership of any commitments made</li>
	<li>Abuse of the freedom that the Agile approach provides</li>
</ol>
So what can be done?
<ul>
	<li>Discuss the issue with the person involved, in private. Obtain a commitment to change if possible. Tools that you should use (in not particular order):
<ul>
	<li>Listen to fears</li>
	<li>Offer mentoring</li>
	<li>Explain the <span>consequences</span> to the team and the in individual.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Seek the removal of the <span>individual</span> involved. Note that they can be so destructive that it's worth getting ride of them even if they are not replaced</li>
	<li>Present the concequences to management and the customer by re-scoping work to accommodate the slippage created by the 9-2-5-er.</li>
</ul>
Please note that I am not suggesting that succesful Agile development teams consist of sad lonely people who spend all their time at the office. However there is a work-life balance as well as a life-work balance and we need to be focused on the our work and the needs of the team.
