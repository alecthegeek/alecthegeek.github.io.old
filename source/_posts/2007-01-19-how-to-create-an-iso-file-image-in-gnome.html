On my Ubuntu 6.10 system the easy way to create an ISO image file is as follows:
<ol>
	<li> Insert the CD (or DVD) into the drive. A CD icon should appear on the desktop after it auto mounts</li>
	<li>Right click on the desktop icon and from the pop up menu select "Copy Disc..."</li>
	<li>On the small dialogue that appears the "Copy disc to:" field probably displays the CD/DVD writer drive. Change  it  to  "File Image".
<ol>
	<li>To  make a  direct CD/DVD media copy on a blank disk leave the field set to the writer drive.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Select the "Write"  button</li>
	<li>On the  next screen modify the file name (keep the ISO file suffix) and directory name as required.</li>
	<li>Select "OK"</li>
</ol>
The copy starts.
