I was at the LittleBird Ardiuno workshop yesterday and suffered substitutional, but easily fixed grief on both Windows 7 and Linux 64bit. In the hope Google will make these notes avliable to others and save them the same pain.....

I was using a Uno board which requires an upgrade to a later IDE version than currently supplied by Ubuntu. No problem, I just downloaded the latest version but failed to review the release notes well enough as I expected it to work out of the box as previously.
