<a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/19/1331231">Slashdot | Ubuntu Feisty Fawn Released</a> <br /> <blockquote>Ubuntu Feisty Fawn Released</blockquote>The new release of Ubuntu is out and I'm keen to upgrade - I'm hoping for much better Wi-Fi support (I have a BMC card) and  some fancy 3D desktop effects.<br /><br />As I have messed my system around so much I think the sensible option is to reformat my disk and re-load from scratch. (thank goodness that most of my work is on&nbsp; a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">SVN</a> server and my email is still the servers).<br /> <br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p>
