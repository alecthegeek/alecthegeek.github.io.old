<a title="Be a Better Consultant" href="http://alecthegeek.files.wordpress.com/2006/12/beagoodonsultant.jpeg"><img src="http://alecthegeek.files.wordpress.com/2006/12/beagoodonsultant.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Be a Better Consultant" align="right" /></a>Updated Jan/2010

This is a follow up to an earlier <a title="How to manage consultants" href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/11/21/how-to-get-the-most-value-for-your-consulting-dollar/">post</a> about manageing consultants and contractors.This time I am looking at how consultants can do a better job for their customers and themselves.

There is obviously a limit on how much information I fit into one picture, but I hope it might be useful to people new in the consulting industry -- you should modify this to fit your own situation of course.

Feedback is always welcome.

The source <a title="Mindmap on GItHub" href="http://github.com/alecthegeek/Presentations/tree/master/Be_a_GoodConsultant/" target="_blank">mindmap</a> for this diagram is on GitHub. You will need a copy of <a title="Freemind Home Page" href="http://www.sf.net/" target="_blank">Freemind</a> (at least Rel 9).
