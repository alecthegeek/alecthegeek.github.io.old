Updated June 2011.

For some time I've using a paper journal to follow the <a title="Getting Shit Done" href="http://utilware.com/gsd3.html" target="_blank">GSD</a> workflow. I've actually been using a thick, 300 page, <a href="http://www.shopmiquelrius.com/servlet/the-230/Miquelrius/Detail">Miquelrius</a> journal, but I'm finding it too bulky and the extra pages means it lasts long enough for the binding to start to fail so I'll be going back to <a title="Moleskine notebooks vendor" href="http://www.moleskine.com/" target="_blank">Moleskine</a> style when the current book is finished. I've also tried <a title="Piccadilly notebooks vendor" href="http://piccadillyinc.com/products/notebooks" target="_blank">Piccadilly</a> notebooks which seem <em>very</em> similar to Moleskine and a lot cheaper, however both of mine have split down the spine. Recently I've also upgraded my workflow to include:
<ul>
	<li><a title="Pomodoro technique" href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">Pomodoro</a> technique to help me focus during the day in getting my longer actions completed</li>
	<li><a title="email inbox zero" href="http://inboxzero.com/inboxzero/" target="_blank">Inbox Zero</a> so I spend less time on email</li>
</ul>
Which have both improved things for me, but I need to improve my weekly review and project planning so I've been looking at moving up the <a title="Getting Things Done explained on Wikupedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" target="_blank">GTD</a> food chain to something a little more complete. After noodling with some UML diagrams I figure it's pretty simple to fix, so this is my new (evolved) plan going forward (none of these ideas are very original).
<ol>
	<li>Keep doing the GSD daily routine. (Turn to a new page, move the bookmark ribbon, date it, write down a list and work the list). Add the number of estimated Pomodoros to tasks to stop you overcommitting yourself</li>
	<li>In the same space keep using pages for <a title="Suggestions for developer notes" href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/11/29/keeping-a-log-book/" target="_blank">notes</a>, GTD inbox, Pomodoros and project planning as needed</li>
	<li>From the back of the book (turn to landscape so I have longer lines) write down actions. This is the GSD master list, but with more structure. A pink tab marks the page with the oldest active action. My column headings were inspired by <a title="Another GTD hack for a paper journal" href="http://anabubula.com/node/40" target="_blank">mGTD</a>. (NA/Competed, Description, Context/Agenda/Waiting, Project, Estimated Pomodoros). My coding for the NA/Completed field is as follows:
<ol>
	<li>Blank -- task has incomplete dependencies</li>
	<li>Box -- task is next action</li>
	<li>Tick -- complete</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Each time a project plan is created (as part of a Pomordoro usually) mark the project plan with a green tag. When the project is no longer active remove the tag</li>
	<li>If a page has notes that might be needed in future fold down a corner so it's quicker to skim to 'important' notes.</li>
	<li>During the weekly review re-visit the previous weeks pages for incomplete actions, etc. Tick pages in top left when reviewed. Visit project tags to review each project</li>
	<li>Use dated pages for X-ref links</li>
</ol>
Note that my approach to Pomodoro is deliberately simplistic so I keep limited notes on each one. As long as I know what my next Pomodoro is, have enough information to keep my day useful and can stay focused that's good enough.

I've been using  a mind map to refine my ideas
