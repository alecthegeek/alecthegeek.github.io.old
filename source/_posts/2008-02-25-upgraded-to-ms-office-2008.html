I've just bitten the bullet and upgraded from MS Office 2004 (for the Mac) to Office 2008. I actually prefer <a href="http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>, but we use Exchange for our corporate email and I am desperate for better calendar and address book support.

I can now check colleagues availability when making appointments, however I can't view shared calendars.

At the moment it keeps asking for access to my keychain every 10 mins and the normal fix does not work :-(

So far I can't access our global address book either.

I wish we used Zimbra!
