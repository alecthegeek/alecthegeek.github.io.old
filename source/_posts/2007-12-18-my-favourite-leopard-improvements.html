After a couple of weeks with Leopard here are my top reasons to switch
<ul>
	<li>WiFi management just works! I had to keep choosing my favourite SSID every time my Macbook woke up under Tiger. Worth the price of entry alone</li>
	<li>It's faster</li>
	<li>Finder is slightly better at displaying information</li>
	<li>I think I like spaces..., but still trying to get used to that</li>
	<li>Stacks is useful</li>
	<li>erhh..  that's it for me. I don't use AppleMail,iCal, iChat etc etc.</li>
</ul>
