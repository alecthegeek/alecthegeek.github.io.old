Last week I attended <a href="http://securecon.unimelb.edu.au/">SecureCon</a>. Here are a few rough notes:<a href="http://securecon.unimelb.edu.au/"><img src="http://securecon.unimelb.edu.au/design/images/securecon3.gif" alt="SecureCon Logo" align="right" height="185" width="298" /></a>
<ul>
	<li>At an attendance cost of $0 it was stunning value for money</li>
	<li><span class="intro"><a href="http://www.damnvulnerablelinux.org/">Damn Vulnerable Linux</a> is a really useful sample of cracking tools and information for the professional</span></li>
	<li><span class="intro"> Security attacks continue to get worse and there is serious money involved</span></li>
	<li><span class="intro">Defence in depth (firewalls, OS patches, bandwidth throttles,  user education, <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2900xl_3500xl/catalyst1900_2820/version8.00.03/scg/02vlans.html#wp8388">VLANS</a> to separate traffic types, security zones, policies and policy updating, continues testing, application architecture and design for security,....)</span></li>
	<li><span class="intro">Assume everything is evil, including traffic from your own network </span></li>
	<li><span class="intro">Protect the data</span></li>
	<li><span class="intro">Constant demands for new functions and access mitigate against closed security (e.g. Javascript is about to get access to the local file system)</span></li>
	<li><span class="intro">New devices (e.g. mobile devices) and new services (in particular VOIP) increase the attack surface, sometimes by an order of magnitude. </span></li>
</ul>
