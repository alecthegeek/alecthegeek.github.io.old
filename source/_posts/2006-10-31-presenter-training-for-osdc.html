<a href="http://www.osdc.com.au"><img src="http://www.osdc.com.au/promotion/_img/logo06.jpg" alt="OSDC 2006" align="right" /></a>The <a href="http://osdc.com.au/index.html">Open Source Developers Conference</a> (Melbourne Australian this December --  <a href="http://osdc.com.au/registration/index.html">book </a>your tickets now!) always has many excellent presentations from very knowledgeable experts. Sometimes however speakers could make better use of their speaking skills to enhance their excellent technical content.

So this  year the committee is offering training to the presenters to help raise the standard even further -- the training is being offered by <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> and <a href="http://headwestsoftware.com/">HeadWest Software</a>. I am pleased to be representing HeadWest and I have started preparing my <a href="http://alecclews.pbwiki.com/PresenterTraining" title="Link to training notes" target="_blank">material</a> on a public WiKi, please feel free to drop by and leave comments.

It feels a pretty exposed way of preparing material :-)
