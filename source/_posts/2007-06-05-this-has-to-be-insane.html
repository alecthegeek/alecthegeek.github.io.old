I can't believe this. It is either extreme caution, so that no one can  accuse the government of doing nothing, or an attempt to create a climate of fear to allow governments to reduce the amount of oversight they tolerate.

I lived in London during the 1980's when we had multiple bomb attacks from the IRA and loss of life. However we still went about our business. I used to watch music in the park and that was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/20/newsid_2515000/2515343.stm">bombed</a>, fortunately that particular lunchtime we had gone to the pub instead -- just proves that drinking in pubs is healthy :-). (BTW, the article is wrong, it was not the first concert of the year because I had been the week before).

I can't believe the current risk is higher than the '80's and then we were urged to behave as if nothing had happened although we were asked to keep our eyes open.

On the bright side maybe this will reduce the number of airplane flights and their affect on climate change
