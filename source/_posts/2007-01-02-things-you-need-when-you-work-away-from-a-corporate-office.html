<a href="http://www.momathome.com/">Judi </a>lists some useful <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/01/01/going-commando-top-10-things-youll-need-to-make-it-as-a-web-worker/">ideas</a> for when you have steeped outside the corporate comfort zone (i.e. freelance working from home). I'd like to add my own suggestions:
<ol>
	<li>Make sure you can access your email via any web browser. Even when your laptop is fried or you can't get to the internet with it you still need to be able to access your email at client sites or from a kiosk (and keep copies of the emails on your mail server). I currently use Google Apps Standard Edition as my mail provider and it works very well (I have considered the issues around letting Google see my business email) and you can't be the price (Free, but I still have to pay for my domain name of course)</li>
	<li>Ensure you have an effective voice mail system</li>
	<li>There should be a proper and adequate filling space for paper records and documents. It makes your life a lot harder when you can't find trivial things.</li>
	<li>Try and have processes and templates for doing the boring stuff. That way you can reduce the number of stupid mistakes, get faster and free up energy for creative work. This type of material needs a regular review (either on a schedule or as it is being used) to make sure that it's continually improved</li>
	<li>Use a version control tool (I use Git, but <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> is also a good choice) to track changes to your digital assets, even my accounting files are under version control. I use a remote private repository supplied by <a title="GitHub hosting service" href="http://gitgub.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, Subversion users can use providers such as <a title="Beanstalk subversion hosting provider" href="http://beanstalkapp.com/" target="_blank">Beanstalk</a>. Using a remote hosting service provides and easy backup</li>
	<li>Look at other applications such a <a title="PBWorks Wiki hosting" href="http://pbworks.com/" target="_blank">PBWorks</a> (Wiki) or <a title="Lighthouse ticket management host" href="http://lighthouseapp.com" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a> (issue tracking) to see if they can be use to develop, maintain and deliver your IP.</li>
</ol>
