Now dropping <a href="http://emacs-app.sourceforge.net/">Emacs</a> in favour of <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> in the belief that it's simpler and easier to use for my limited needs.

So export <code>SVN_EDITOR=/usr/bin/edit</code> if using subversion as well, after installing the TextWrangler command line tools
