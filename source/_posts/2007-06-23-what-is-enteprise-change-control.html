Tool vendors love to talk about 'Enterprise Change Control' but what does that mean? Here are some attributes that I think define this label. Obviously there is further detail to be inserted behind each point (but hopefully all that will be revealed at <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a>)
<ul>
	<li>Captures everything
E.g. bugs, questions, initiatives, enhancements,...</li>
	<li>Does not drop anything</li>
	<li>Does things the same (best) way every time</li>
	<li>Records risks and progress</li>
	<li>Authorises the risks and work</li>
	<li>Keeps historical information</li>
	<li>Is regularly reviewed for improvement</li>
	<li>Is appropriate for the task at hand</li>
	<li>Supports a clear “<a title="Define line of sight" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/line-of-sight" target="_blank">line of sight</a>” from request to implementation</li>
	<li>Supports and reinforces the “<a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2007/05/20/dimensions-of-change/">Dimensions of Change</a>”</li>
</ul>
