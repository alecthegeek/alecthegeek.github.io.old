I've been a little quiet on the Internet over the last couple of days as the recent wind blew the skylight off the roof and smashed it :-(. It is very surprising how hard it is to:
<ul>
	<li>Purchase a replacement skylight -- there are no standard sizes</li>
	<li>Find someone who can obtain and fix a new skylight</li>
</ul>
Anyway -- I have done a quick hardware hack and hope to get a better solution real soon.
