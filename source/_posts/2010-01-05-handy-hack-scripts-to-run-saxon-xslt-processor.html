To save people having to reinvent the wheel here are a) a Windows batch file and b) Cygwin shell script to run the Saxon XSLT processor

```
@echo off

rem Run Saxon

c:\Progra~1\java\jre6\bin\java.exe -jar c:\Progra~1\Saxon9.2\saxon9he.jar %*
```

``` bash
#!/bin/sh

# Run Saxon

/Progra~1/java/jre6/bin/java.exe -jar c:\\Progra~1\\Saxon9.2\\saxon9he.jar "$@"
echo
```

On UNIX or Linux

``` bash
#!/bin/sh

# Run Saxon

/usr/bin/java -jar /usr/local/saxonhe/saxon9he.jar "$@"
```

You'll obvioulsy need to modify the paths to suite the locations where you have things installed
