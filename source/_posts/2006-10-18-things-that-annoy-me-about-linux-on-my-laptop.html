When I first became self-employed I very diligently (well, fairly diligently) researched the market for a laptop machine and was delighted to find a HP nx6125 for a neat price (A$1700), I also researched Linux compatibility and whilst there are issues, by and large it works. However there are some things that continue to <em>really</em> annoy me.
<ul>
	<li>I cannot hibernate or sleep. I suspect a problem with my video driver although I appear to have the ATI driver installed correctly and other people are reporting success with sleep mode.</li>
	<li>I have USB headphones that work perfectly with Skype and <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a>. However all other sound (e.g. Music CD's) insists on coming out of the speakers. BTW, if you have audio jacks on your PC don't buy USB headphones -- they are bulky and take up a USB socket</li>
	<li>It took me 6 months to get Wireless working :-(, but at least it works now. Thanks to the <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/">Ndiswrapper</a> team for saving my life</li>
	<li>I cannot get the sychronisation for my Pocket PC mobile phone working</li>
	<li>Nothing to do with Linux, but because of cost I compromised and accepted a machine with a trackerpad instead of a G spot. After 6 months I can say that the IBM G spot (also available on some HP machines) is far superior.</li>
</ul>
