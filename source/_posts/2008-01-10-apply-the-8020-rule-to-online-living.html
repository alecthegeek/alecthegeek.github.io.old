<blockquote>Goodbye to most of Web 2.0</blockquote>
My New Year resolution to cut out Web 2.0 cruft from my life is now happening. The motivation is two fold
<ol>
	<li>To try and reclaim back the many hours that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-blogging">micro-blogging</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Networking">social networks </a>consume</li>
	<li>Reduce the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_Surface">attack surface</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_Theft">identity thieves</a>.</li>
</ol>
So far I have removed accounts on <a href="http://orkut.com">Orkut</a>, <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>, <a href="http://plaxo.com/">Plaxo</a> and <a href="http://vox.com/">Vox</a>. I'm waiting to hear back from <a href="http://dopplr.com/">Dopplr</a> on how to remove my account and I've removed as many applications from my <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>(fb) profile as possible. Depending on Kate's <a href="http://carruthk.blogspot.com/2007/12/trying-hard-to-cancel-myspace-account.html">experience</a> I'll try and drop <a href="http://myspace.com/">myspace</a> as well.

I did de-activate my fb account as my first action, however within 24 hours I had to start using it again as it contained essential contact information and it's just too hard to keep my local address book updated...

So I'm hoping that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80/20_rule">80% of my needs will be meet by 20%</a> of my previous site memberships
