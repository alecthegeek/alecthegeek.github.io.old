An <a href="http://nettalk.sun.com/bhive/main/content/launch?id=1389">presentation</a> from <a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/ceo/bio.jsp?name=Robert%20Worrall">Bob Worrall</a>, CIO at <a href="http://sun.com/">Sun</a>, on the the future of the IT dept predicts that significant in house application development and hosting is finished as we all integrate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SaaS">Software as a Service</a> (Saas) offerings from various 3rd party vendors.

However, whilst we are seeing traction in this area, I have yet to see any significant architectural solution to handling the security and integrity of corporate and private data. Until that happens I can see that any significant adoption of SaaS across large enterprises will be a train wreck.

Wait for the first scandals as organisations and individuals lost control of their data.
