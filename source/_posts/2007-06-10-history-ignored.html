The <a href="http://ncr.com/about_ncr/company_overview/history.jsp?lang=EN">NCR History</a> page does not mention ATM's anywhere in the company's long 125 years, which is odd considering that they saved the company financial bacon (IMHO).

As you can probably tell NCR ATM's figured large in my life. I started work in London in 1982 working on the 1780 ATM, which was programmed in a rather bizarre proprietary language called TPL. It had paged banked memory (to fit 256K into a 64K address space). Despite all there limitations the family and it's successors (I also worked in the 1770, 5080 and 5081) were world class machines - designed and built in <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=NCR&amp;near=Dundee,+UK&amp;radius=0.0&amp;cd=1&amp;cid=56461428,-2968111,1213602661974402117&amp;li=lmd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;ll=56.479842,-3.045101&amp;spn=0.010712,0.058365&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A">Dundee</a>, Scotland, where I was lucky enough to be seconded on a few occasions. I finally left the world of ATMs in 1989.
