Previously, like probably 80% of other users, I had only used <a title="Putty home page" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" target="_blank">Putty</a> as a ssh enabled terminal emulator. However after my adventures with emacs I've come to realise what a great tool it is, including it's support for comand line use.

If you are stuck using Windows without OpenSSH (e.g. not using Cygwin) then I recommend you get Putty.

Some of it's features are:
<ul>
	<li>Key generation and management (including import/export of OpenSSH keys)</li>
	<li>A key caching utility (so you don't have to keep typing the key passphrase)</li>
	<li>command line ssh support vi plink</li>
	<li>support for scp and sftp (pscp and psftp)</li>
</ul>
Every time I've used it it's been rock solid and handled everything thrown at it (including things that OpenSSH had trouble with -- although to be fair that was probably not OpenSSH's fault)
