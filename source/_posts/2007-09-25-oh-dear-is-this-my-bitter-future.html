<blockquote>I blame Steve Jobs, who has seduced me into buying his sleek machines, even if their delicate organs seem to fail with alarming regularity, like the beautiful consumptive heroines in Victorian novels.</blockquote>
I bought into the Mac deal because:
<ul>
	<li>we have an iMac at home and it was a great experience</li>
	<li>a fully tricked out Dell latop was the same price as a similar Macbook</li>
	<li>I think it's a well made piece of hardware and software</li>
	<li>it's UNIX and that's more secure and stable and of course</li>
	<li>it's really cool...</li>
</ul>
Am I due to take a huge prattfall?
