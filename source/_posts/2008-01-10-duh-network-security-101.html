<br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7179823.stm">BBC NEWS | Business | Boeing 787 hit by security fears</a> <br /> <blockquote>Boeing has been ordered to ensure passengers on its new 787 Dreamliner jet cannot hack into the flight system and take control of the plane.</blockquote><br />I wonder which idiot at Boeing didn't ensure there was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_%28computing%29">air gap</a> between the passenger and avionic networks on the new 787? My customers on the ground have been using such a simple approach for many, many years.<br /><br />If I was being unprofessional and bitchy I might even suggest it must have have a been a Microsoft security consultant.<br /> <br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p>
