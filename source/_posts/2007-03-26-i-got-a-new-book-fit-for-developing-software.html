<a href="http://fit.c2.com/">FIT</a>
<blockquote>Fit is a tool for enhancing collaboration in software development.</blockquote>
I just bought Mugridge and Ward's <a href="http://fit.c2.com/wiki.cgi?FitBook">book</a> on using the <a href="http://fit.c2.com/">Framework for Integrated Tests</a>. I have only got as far as Ch 4 but I am very excited about how this approach  might:
<ol>
	<li>Help my conversations with <a href="http://fit.c2.com/wiki.cgi?CustomerGuide">customers</a> by encouraging the use of Fit documents and</li>
	<li>Reducing development overhead by making it easier to implement automated testing for business rules</li>
</ol>
I hope to get a chance to try this on some projects in the next 3-4 months so watch this space.
