<a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=47948&amp;topic=1556">Gmail: Help Center - How should I use POP on mobile or multiple devices?</a>
<blockquote>If you're accessing your Gmail using POP from multiple clients, Gmail's recent mode makes sure that all messages are made available to each client</blockquote>
<b><i>Update Nov/2007: Gmail now supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">imap</a>, which would be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol#Advantages_over_POP3">better</a> choice than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol">POP</a> for most purposes</i></b>. Use imap in preference to  POP if you can and ignore the information in this post

In Gmail default POP setup once a POP client has downloaded a message is no longer available to other clients :-(. I currently use my laptop, smartphone and occasionally an iMac for POP access to Gmail.

I recently found this very brief documentation on using Gmail recent mode, which is claimed to fix this issue

The documentation is not clear so my initial, experimental, set-up will be as follows:

1) Set my main laptop mail client to be in recent mode (Evolution), this has made it download 800 email again. I assume that is the only the first time
2) I will leave my smarphone in default mode so it only gets new email
3) I will probably make Mac mail start in recent mode as well.

UpdatedAugust 2007: I 've made all my email clients use the recent:account@gmail.com format and it works well.

Top tip. Delete all the gmail pop email from your  client before you make the change as it all gets marked for download again and you end up with loads of duplicates.
