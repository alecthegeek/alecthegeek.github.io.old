My <strike>arch nemesis</strike> erh good chum, Andrew, thinks <a href="http://aabs.wordpress.com/2007/02/02/why-open-source-software-development-environments-are-crap/">Open Source IDEs are Crap!</a> . Well I have to say that he's rather behind the times. Industry commentators (well mainly me actually) have been <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2004/06/17/108747492485585638/">decrying</a> the use of IDE's for some time, both open source and commercial. Although I have to recognise the reality that they are here to stay,  using IDE's does present come challenges for modern teams -- and the more in-experienced the practitioner then the more serious the problems that can be introduced (which is the same with most things).
