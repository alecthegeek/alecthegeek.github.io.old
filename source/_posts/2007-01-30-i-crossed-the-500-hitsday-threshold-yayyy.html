Yayyy!!!! Â« The Wandering Glitch 2</a> <br /> <blockquote>Today I had record stats on my blog</blockquote>I read this post on Andrew's blog with some envy a few weeks ago as I was struggling to get above 50 on most days. Now today I have suddenly jumped to 517 (so far) and it turns out that it's mainly due to Andrew and my <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2007/01/23/agile-is-not-a-panacea-neither-is-it-a-cure-all/">discussion</a> about Agile development. Someone liked what we said and send my post to <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/url.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Falecthegeek.wordpress.com%2F2007%2F01%2F23%2Fagile-is-not-a-panacea-neither-is-it-a-cure-all%2F">Stumble Upon</a><br /><br />So many thanks Andrew and I think you may have got a few extra hits as well.<br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">powered by <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">performancing firefox</a></p>
