<blockquote>There's some contention over where exactly Gen Y starts and stops - some say those born 1983-1997, others think 1982-1997. In this week's Entertainment Weekly, Gen Y is defined as "current 13 to 31 year-olds" and BusinessWeek says they can be as young as five. Regardless, we know who they are - they're the young kids of today, the most digitally active generation yet, having been born plugged in.</blockquote>
When I have a working laptop at home I drive my wife mad as I surf <a href="http://facebook.com/">facebook </a>and post on <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> whilst <a title="Alec watching Dr Who and playing with svk" href="http://alecthegeek.jaiku.com/presence/33936620" target="_blank">watching</a> TV. I always want to put information on Wikis (with o<a href="http://goaustralia.about.com/cs/language/a/strineo.htm">pen slather</a> for everyone to update it) when my colleagues don't understand the benefit and I'm posting here when I should be working on something else. I'm a man 25 years before my time!

Or perhaps I can just tell people I'm 22 years old?
