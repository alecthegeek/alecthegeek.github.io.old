The time has come to take my web development skills to the next level, so I have started reading <a href="http://www.peachpit.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0321430840&amp;rl=1">HTML, XHTML, and CSS, Sixth Edition: Visual QuickStart Guide</a> by <a href="http://www.cookwood.com/">Elizabeth Castro</a>.

It's a fairly gentle introduction, and the layout (lots of pictures) is well suited to the material -- so far I am well pleased with my purchase. You can expect to see improvements in the few websites I maintain (I won't post the addresses here until I have made the improvements as it's just too embarrassing -- too many tables for layout).
