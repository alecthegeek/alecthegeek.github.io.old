Currently I am feeling very cut off as the latop is at the menders having it's drive electronics diagnosed. However as soon as it gets back I shall be off to the land of <a title="Git home page" href="http://git.or.cz/" target="_blank">Git</a> after re-reading <a title="Sam Vilain's blog" href="http://vilain.net/">Sam</a>'s updated (and excellent) git-svn <a title="git-svn tutorial" href="http://utsl.gen.nz/talks/git-svn/intro.html#howto-fetch-slow">tutorial</a>. Git is designed for distributed use, is fast and I'm assured very flexible...

Of course I may not wait that long as I'm being tempted to purchase an <a title="HP 2133 UMPC" href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06b/321957-321957-64295-321838-306995-3687084-3687085-3704509.html?jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN">HP 2133</a>, despite it having a Broadcomm wirelessÂ adaptor and all the bloody <a title="define aggro" href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=aggro" target="_blank">aggro</a> that entails.
