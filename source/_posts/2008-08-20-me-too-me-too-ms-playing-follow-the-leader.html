<a href="http://www.officelabs.com/projects/speedlaunch/Pages/default.aspx">Speed Launch</a><br /><blockquote>Community prototypes are projects Microsoft employees work on in their spare time</blockquote><br />I hate to be mean, but it looks like Microsoft have decided to follow Google's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google#Innovation_time_off" target="_blank">lead</a> and provide an avenue for employees to work on personal projects. Not sure if MS provide just the website or also encourage employees to have time as well.
