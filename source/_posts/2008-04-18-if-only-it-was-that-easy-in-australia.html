Or just evolution?</a> <br /> <blockquote>...many of us are becoming technology nomads, carrying less and less with us in our daily travels because we know where the oasis (of WiFI rather than water)...</blockquote><br />Oh if only it was that easy in Australia. There are so few open WiFi spots here (mainly because if the high cost of net access) that it's a real struggle to wander and work. There are a few pay per use services (e.g. Telstra) -- however they can be very expensive. We are seeing a lot of 3G wireless services being pushed as well, but cost is again an issue and they are limited to business use.<br /><br />Maybe one day we'll get cheap pervasive networking here (I know it's better that many places in the world, but for a modern economy it's pretty poor)<br />
