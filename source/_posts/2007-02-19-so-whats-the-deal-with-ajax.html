I have been spending the last few weeks working in an Ajax environment and whilst I am no Ajax expert there are some observations I feel compelled to make.
<ol>
	<li>The benefits are substantial for the end user of your software (interaction, features offered...) so it's worth doing.</li>
	<li>It's a pain to debug because you are spreading your code across multiple locations and languages.</li>
	<li>It's worth using a templating system (e.g. <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/" title="Mason web site">HTML::Mason</a>) when writing web apps, with or without Ajax. It makes live a lot easier when generating mark up.</li>
	<li>The Ajax paradigm leads to a different architecture at the back end. Something like this:
<ol>
	<li>A module generates
<ol>
	<li>Some Basic HTML and place holders for data, but no data</li>
	<li>Lots of Javascript (but remember to use an Ajax library such as <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/" title="Yahoo User Interface Library">YUI</a>)</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>This first page loads and makes an Ajax call</li>
	<li>A second module on the server responds to your Ajax call and supplies data (or whatever)</li>
	<li>The web page is populated by the Javascript via the DOM and and can be used.</li>
	<li>The user interacts with your Javascript (and forms etc.)</li>
	<li>Your Javascript makes an Ajax call</li>
	<li>goto 3</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
So you can see what I mean about things being spread around.  It's a lot harder to work with that a traditional form based approach.
