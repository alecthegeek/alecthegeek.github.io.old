Or should that be Perl in an Agile World?

There was a discussion tonight at Melbourne Perl Mongers on using Agile practices whilst Perl programming. To my delight the answer from attendees was 'Yes we do that every day'! Specifically there was a discussion around:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> frameworks</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refactoring">Refactoring</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Continuous  integration</a> and how important is is to have an SCM tool that makes developer branches (and merging) easy</li>
	<li>Perl <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">Mock Objects</a> for testing</li>
	<li>How to apply TDD to code that is not OO or even a proper module</li>
</ul>
There is a Yahoo Group on <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeperl/">Perl Extreme Programming</a> and an online <a href="http://www.extremeperl.org/bk/home">book</a>
