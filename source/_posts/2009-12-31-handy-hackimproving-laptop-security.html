I have always liked having my laptop BIOS boot password on. i.e.  you can't even boot from a CD unless you have first supplied credentials. However I've always been too lazy in the past to login 'twice', once to the BIOS and then to the operating system (OS) as a user. I've got around that as follows:
<ol>
	<li>Make sure that your screen saver is password protected and enabled</li>
	<li>Make sure your OS requires a password after resume</li>
	<li>Enable automatic user login.</li>
</ol>
Now you have to supply credentials every time you want to renew access to the machine, but you only have to supply credentials once on boot.
<ul>
	<li>This is only useful if the machine is used exclusively  by you</li>
	<li>You can either use '<code>sudo</code>' (Linux and OS/X) and '<code>runas</code>' (MS Windows) or logout/login to run programs as another user.</li>
</ul>
