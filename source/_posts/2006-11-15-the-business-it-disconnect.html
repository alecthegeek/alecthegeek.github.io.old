How many times have you heard the phrase "IT needs to learn how to connect with the business and correctly address it's needs, until then we will continue to have failed projects etc etc.", or similar?

Now this is quite true -- unless IT is delivering services and software that helps the organisation survive and prosper then we deserve all the <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=opprobrium">opprobrium</a> that is heaped upon us.<!--more-->

However I get a little irked when the rest of the organisation is not held to the same standards. Examples include:
<ol>
	<li>Sales teams who sell for the purposes of maximising their personal bonus rather than the longer term success of the company</li>
	<li>Accounts departments who see the collection of information and filling in of forms as an end in its self rather than something than will assist the business in being more successful by making decisions</li>
	<li>Personnel teams who are inflexible in their application of policy and hinder others and their response to changing needs and circumstances</li>
</ol>
So instead of there being an IT problem we have <em>all</em> become business <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocrat_%28derogatory%29">technocrats</a> unable to think outside our little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_effect">silos</a>
