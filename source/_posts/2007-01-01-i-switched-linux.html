<blockquote>Ubuntu is a complete Linux-based operating system</blockquote>
Well after the Novell/Microsoft debacle I switched from <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Welcome_to_openSUSE.org">OpenSUSE</a> to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. It worked fairly well although wireless does not yet work. A big step forward is that my laptop now sleeps, and so should I!.

Ubuntu seems to be the hot distro. at the moment, I recommend taking it for a spin if you are shopping for a new Linux.

Some top tips:
<ol>
	<li>If the standard desktop ISO images do not work then there is an Alternative version. Try that</li>
	<li>Install and use <a href="http://www.getautomatix.com/" title="Automatix web site">Automatix</a></li>
</ol>
And a happy 2007 to all my readers as well.
