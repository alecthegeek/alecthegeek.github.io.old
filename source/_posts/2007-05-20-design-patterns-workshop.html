Yesterday I went to the <a href="http://cogentconsulting.com.au/">Cogent</a> Design Patterns <a href="http://wiki.cogentconsulting.com.au/confluence/display/PUB/Design+Patterns%2C+May+19%2C+2007">workshop</a>. A good time to was had and many interesting discussions around various aspects of patterns and OO programming occured.

Considering I am now a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy_Haired_Boss">PHB</a> I managed to keep my end up very well I thought :-). Many thanks to <a href="http://www.atug.com/andypatterns/">Andy Bulk</a>a and the other delegates for a great time.
