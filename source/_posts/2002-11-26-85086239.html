Well, that was some break.

I have now bought and moved to a new house in the boring suburbs of eastern Melbourne and at even got my cable modem working after a week of fannying around!

I will try and keep this up to date now

-- I have TortoiseCVS working to the Sourceforge CVS repository, out of the box using the Cygwin ssh client
