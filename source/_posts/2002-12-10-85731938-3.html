Well it's 03:00am and I have abad headache, so I thought I'd catch up. Doing lit search for RequireFreedom which has been real cool. Currenlty reading "Writing Effective Use Cases". I was
hoping to use an exisitng UML tool for requirments management  -- however I suspect that it will require a dedicated tool with WP and Use Case features.

Currenlty running training courses at work, which is fun but real hard work. These customers are pretty bright so it makes it intresting.
