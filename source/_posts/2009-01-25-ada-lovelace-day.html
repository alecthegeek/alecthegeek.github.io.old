<a href="http://www.en-gb.pledgebank.com/AdaLovelaceDay">'I will publish a blog post on Tuesday 24th March about a woman in technology whom I admire' - PledgeBank</a><br /><blockquote>Ada Lovelace Day is an international day of blogging to draw attention to women excelling in technology. Women's contributions often go unacknowledged, their innovations seldom mentioned, their faces rarely recognised. We want you to tell the world about these unsung heroines. Whatever she does, whether she is a sysadmin or a tech entrepreneur, a programmer or a designer, developing software or hardware, a tech journalist or a tech consultant, we want to celebrate her achievements.</blockquote><br />I had to think long and hard about who I could blog about. It has been my very great pleasure to work with, and know, a whole range of women in IT -- software sales, post doctoral researchers, trainees, configuration managers, Linuxchix, Perl hackers and so on. It was impossible to chose a single person so I thought I'd write about them all (as far as that's possible).<br /><br />I hate to make generalisations, but in my experience women in IT seem to set often set a the standard for their male colleagues in two key areas:<br /><ul><li>Integrity</li><li>Inclusivness</li></ul><br />
