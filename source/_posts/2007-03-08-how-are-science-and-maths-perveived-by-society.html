<blockquote>'...fewer than 6 percent of high-school seniors in the U.S. are planning on engineering degrees. A decade ago it was 36 percent. In 2000, 56 percent of the undergraduate degrees in China were in the hard sciences. In the U.S., 1 percent.</blockquote>
I wonder if the US is starting to gather the harvest from it's apparent antipathy against hard science? (Possibly fuelled by the conservative, religious, right.)

It would be interesting to know if there is a similar trend in other western countries? Or, at the risk of sounding like a grumpy old fart, are maths and science subjects too hard for the current calibre of student?

Whatever it is, it's probably not good -- although of course at the in individual level it creates great opportunities for the people who choose to study these subjects.
