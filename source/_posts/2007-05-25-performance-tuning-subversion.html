Information from IBM on SVN performance when managing binary files and directories of files

<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-svnbins.html?ca=dgr-lnxw01javapts">Performance tuning Subversion</a>
<blockquote>Performance tuning Subversion</blockquote>
The basic conclusion to be drawn from the article is that
<ul>
	<li>Don't store deltas of binary files. It takes too long</li>
	<li>Compress binaries before storing them</li>
</ul>
Another technique discussed in the article the archiving of a complete directory structures into a single file. This single file is then placed in Subversion as a configuration item (CI -- the technical term for a file or anything else placed under version control).

This technique is very useful (ignoring issues relating to performance) in certain limited version control scenarios. For example:

Scenario1:

When a tool generates a substantial number of files (e.g. a code generator) it often does not make sense to track changes to individual files because they all be regenerated the next time the tool is used.

Scenario2:

A package is released as a set of files. After the release build the complete set of file is managed as a single CI. Any change to a small part of the system creates a complete new release.
