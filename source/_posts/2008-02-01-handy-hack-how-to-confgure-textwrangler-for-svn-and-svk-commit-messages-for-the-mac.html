In a similar fashion to a previous <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2007/01/22/handy-hack-how-to-confgure-gvim-for-svn-and-svk-commit-messages/">post</a> about gvim you can use <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> as your SVN or SVN log message editor by setting <code>$SVN_EDITOR</code> to the value of <code>"/usr/bin/edit -w"</code> and install the TextWrangler command line tools. I'm guessing that something similar would also work for <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">BBEdit</a> as well.
