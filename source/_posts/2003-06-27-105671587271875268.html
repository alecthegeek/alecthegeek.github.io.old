Pretty quite here of late.

I have been having thought about <a href="http://requirefreedom.sourceforge.net/">RequireFreedom</a>. It seems to me the major issue with requirments management is traceability. The answer may to provide a XML web sevices interface so that any external application (e.g. test tools, documentation harnesses etc.) can access individual requirments.
