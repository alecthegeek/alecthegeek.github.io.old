According to <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlbp/">Perl Best Practices</a>, a.k.a PBP, the "<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061231072330AAMi9rq">One True Way</a>" to implement Objects is using a technique called inside-out. Unfortunately reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Conway">Daminan's</a> explanation, although as usual excellent in many ways, did my head in because I could not imagine how the storage was logically laid out (I'm kinda old fashioned in how I understand things you see).

Luckily a quick <a href="http://www.voy.com/115358/3/9992.html">FWSEy</a> and I was able to find <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Australia's</a> cool <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/2006-03-31.html">explanation</a> that lays out the way the attribute hashes store values in inside-out objects. I suggest you print out a copy, fold it up and place inside PBP (What do you mean, you don't have a copy? I hope you're not a Perl programmer). The content is Open so you can do that, Hurrah for Open Content I say.

There are still a number of questions in my mind about how this works but perhaps I can find someone at next <a href="http://melbourne.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> meetings, in a <a href="http://www.goatbeer.com.au/">brewery </a>this month, to fill in the gaps. I'm afraid the website is wrong about the meeting BTW -- it's on Friday 12/Jan.
