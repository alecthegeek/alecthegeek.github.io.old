I <a title="Using TaskCoach to support Pomodoro" href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2009/12/29/using-taskcoach-with-pomodoro/" target="_blank">posted</a> recently about using the <a title="TaskCoach home page" href="http://taskcoach.org/" target="_blank">TaskCoach</a> list manager to support the <a title="Pomodoro Technique home page" href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">Pomodoro</a> Technique for actually doing work. Of course Pomodoro does not address the issue of task identification and organisation -- so I promised a post on using TaskCoach and <a title="GTD explained on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" target="_blank">Getting Things Done</a> (GTD) as  GTD and Pomodoro complement each other nicely.

Setup:
<ol>
	<li>Install <a title="TaskCoach home page" href="http://taskcoach.org/" target="_blank">TaskCoach</a></li>
	<li>Create Taskcoach categories that reflect the various GTD categories, i.e
<ul>
	<li>Next Action ( I call it ".Next Action" so it sorts to the top of the list)</li>
	<li>Deferred</li>
	<li>Someday/Maybe</li>
	<li>Waiting</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Under Next Action create sub categories to represent your contexts. e.g.
<ul>
	<li>".Next Action/Errand"</li>
	<li>".Next Action/Web"</li>
	<li>".Next Action/Laptop"</li>
	<li>".Next Action/Telephone" etc...</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Create a sub category called ".Next Action/_Agenda" (use underscore so that it sorts at the end of the next action list, alternatively make Agenda a top level category). Under that create categories for the people in your life e.g.
<ul>
	<li>".Next Action/_Agenda/Wife"</li>
	<li>".Next Action/_Agenda/Boss"</li>
	<li>".Next Action/_Agenda/SalesGuyOnCurrenProject" etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Optionally make ".Next Action" mutually exclusive on sub categories (suggested by the mailing list)</li>
	<li>Create the same people centric categories under Waiting</li>
	<li>In preferences select the following
<ul>
	<li>"Use Tabbed Interface.." off (you need to see context and task list at once)</li>
	<li>"Allow for tasking notes" on (optional but useful)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Edit the ".Next Action" category and make it a different colour (NB Not red as that will hide overdue tasks)</li>
	<li>Optionally make</li>
	<li>Optionally add additional columns to the task view (suggested by the TaskCoach mailing list). It can be useful to add a column for category so that tasks can be sorted by category or context.</li>
</ol>
Using it:
<ol>
	<li>Create top level tasks for your current projects. Create actions as subtasks under projects (You can drag and drop tasks between or into projects)</li>
	<li>Add new actions to the list in the normal fashion, so the task list becomes an inbox as well</li>
	<li>Add due and start dates as required
<ul>
	<li>Deferred  actions</li>
	<li>Delegated actions</li>
	<li>Tasks with a real due date</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Review tasks in the task list (daily) by
<ul>
	<li>Selecting “Tree of tasks/List of tasks” as you progress to see context (or not)</li>
	<li>Assigning the correct Next Action context to tasks during review. NB Only one NA category should be used</li>
	<li>Moving new actions to the correct projects</li>
	<li>Removing Next Action category from completed tasks</li>
	<li>Using the other categories as appropriate</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Now click on the ".Next Action" category and only next actions are displayed. Selecting a specific sub category (and de-selecting the higher ".Next Action") will further filter by context</li>
</ol>
