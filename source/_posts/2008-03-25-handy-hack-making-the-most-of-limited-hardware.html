I have  recently been setting up an old PC as a backup system for my office enviroment. However 10 year old hardware does have it's limitations so I had to go through a few hoops to get it to my liking.
<ol>
	<li>Install latest <a href="http://debian.org/">Debian</a> as <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> got a little upset with the old BIOS and disk drives</li>
	<li>Make sure that the system has sshd installed, i.e. <code>apt-get install ssh</code></li>
	<li>Stop the graphical login running by executing <code>update-rc.d -f gdm remove</code></li>
	<li>Install <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">xfce4</a> (it uses less resources than KDE or GNOME), <code>apt-get install xfce4</code></li>
	<li>Make xfce4 the X window manager by creating a file <code>~/.Xsession</code> with the line '<code>exec xfce4-seesion</code>'</li>
</ol>
Now you can log onto the Linux console and type <code>startx</code> or use a remote X server display, e.g. X11 on OS/X using ssh X tunnelling.

e.g. <code>ssh -X -l &lt;userName&gt;  &lt;machineName&gt;</code>

When using a remote X server there can be problems if you do <b>not</b> start some programs in an X term  displayed by the X server and for which you started your X tunnel. e.g. xclock does not care, GNUCash crashes the X server. So make sure your X server displays an X term of some description.
