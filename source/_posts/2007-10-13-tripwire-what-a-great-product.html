As regular readers know I recently joined <a href="http://tripwire.com/">Tripwire</a> as a technical manager. I recently had my first round of presentations to customers and an opportunity to show off the product. It was interesting to hear a variety of needs around different platforms, applications and processes.

<a href="http://www.tripwire.com/products/enterprise/index.cfm">Tripwire Enterprise</a> was easy to talk about -- it has a great user interface and a really well defined set of features. Sales presentations are all abut aligning these features to the customers priorities, instead of bending the product the to look like it's what the customer might need (which has often been my experience with other applications).

If you need to identity the changes going on in your data centre then make sure you give it a look
