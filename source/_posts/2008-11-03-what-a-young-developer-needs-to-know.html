I occasionally ponder on what skills and knowledge a novice who wants to become a skilled developer should acquire. In no particular order here is a suggested list of things to consider:
<ul>
	<li>Basic accounting: This is useful from both an IT perspective -- a lot of IT systems are used for financial management; and from a general work perspective because it helps with your future in business</li>
	<li>Version control concepts and tools</li>
	<li>Waterfall Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC): Requirements, design, building, testing, release</li>
	<li>Agile SDLC such as XP and/or Scrum</li>
	<li>How to use a command line</li>
	<li>Basic compiler architecture -- the 7 phases of compiling</li>
	<li>Data representation: Number bases (binary, Hex, BCD); character sets; XML markup</li>
	<li>Basic algorithms: Sorting, Linked lists etc, recursion,...</li>
	<li>Important design patterns</li>
	<li>Testing and quality as a substantial stand alone topic</li>
	<li>Programming in at least three languages: C (or Java, C++, Ada etc), Perl (or Python, Ruby etc) plus one other (e.g. Lisp, Haskell). At least one needs to be an OO language and OO programming should be a familiar habit. Perl does <strong>not</strong> count as OO for this discussion.</li>
	<li>How to use a word processor and spreadsheet</li>
	<li>Basic SQL, RDBMS architectures, 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Normal forms and basic DB schema design</li>
	<li>TCP/IP networking and basics of http, email, ftp, etc. Needs to include conceptual understanding of DNS and related security issues</li>
	<li>Basic IT security concepts</li>
	<li>Basic IT System Management</li>
	<li>Personal task and work management (e.g. <a title="GTD task management" href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done" target="_blank">GTD</a> or <a title="GSD task management" href="http://utilware.com/gsd3.html" target="_blank">GSD</a>, suggested by <a href="http://sinewalker.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Sinewalker</a>)</li>
	<li>Maintaining personal work records in aÂ  <a title="Keeping a log book" href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/11/29/keeping-a-log-book/" target="_blank">log book</a></li>
</ul>
Further topics
<ul>
	<li>More advanced RDBMS use and schema design</li>
	<li>Embedded systems</li>
	<li>How to use LaTeX or Docbook</li>
	<li>Application engineering for quality (maintenance, extensibility, performance etc)</li>
	<li>OS design</li>
	<li>Requirements engineering</li>
	<li>UML</li>
</ul>
Further suggestions anyone?
