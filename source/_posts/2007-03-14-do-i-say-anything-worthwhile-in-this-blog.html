I'm having some 'issues' around the idea of publishing my thoughts in this blog. Some of the topics I talk about are complex and would require substantial and detailed exposition to discuss properly. However the constraints of time and space (the blog format really seems to be limited to less than a 1000 words, and usually a lot less than that) means that usually it's not possible to give a topic full justice.

Will my readers assume that my thinking and knowledge is equally simplistic? Is a blog the correct format to publish such material ?

For many successful blog writers the format seems to work. However with the amount of time at my disposal I think I need to publish less often and present more substantive articles, or a series of posts with much more detailed material.

I have recently been thinking about the issues of successful development management, so I propose to create a series of articles around the topic --- just don't expect them to appear quickly.
