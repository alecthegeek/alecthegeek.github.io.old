I've just activated my <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> account and here is one of my favourite pictures -- Jack and I fooling around with my camera phone (which not longer works since I upgraded to Pocket Windows 2003 SP 2) in a restaurant.

I'm thinking up upgrading to a Samsung <a href="http://www.samsung.com/au/blackjack/">Blackjack</a> which would allow to take better quality photos (as well as make phone calls)
