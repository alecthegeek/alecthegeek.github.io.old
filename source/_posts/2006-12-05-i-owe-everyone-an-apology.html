After attending <a href="http://amanda.dd.com.au/" title="Amanda's home page">Amanda's</a> excellent <a href="http://osdc.com.au/papers/tutorials.html#css" title="OSDC CSS Tutorial">tutorial</a> on CSS it appears that I have been completlty wrong in setting up my links to open in an external page, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/alecclews" target="_blank" title="An example link">like this one</a>.

Aplogies to anyone who has found this really annoying.  I will do better in the future and hopefully I'll go back and fix old posts as I make updates.
