A colleague from Melbourne Perl Mongers has started a new <a href="http://www.freehouse.com.au/">web site</a> called Free House, providing free property listing services for the Australia market. I have no idea how he's going to make money as I can't see any adverts! However I wish him the best of luck.

If you're looking to sell or rent then why not try it? It costs nothing.
