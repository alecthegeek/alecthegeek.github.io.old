This is so cool! I found someone has been using the Google Arabic translation service to view my blog. I asked my wife how good the translation is, but her Arabic has become very rusty, although apparently my name is correct.

I'm guessing if you don't have the correct fonts installed then the above quote will not appear correctly - sorry.

(Updated: I've also discovered I'm linked from a Spanish language site at <a href="http://www.taquiones.net/perl/blogs.html">http://www.taquiones.net/perl/blogs.html</a>, along with a bunch of other people who can actually program in Perl and have written books to prove it)
