My much used copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lamb-Lies-Down-Broadway/dp/B000002J1S/sr=8-1/qid=1164771369/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-7527835-2651042?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music">The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway</a> is wearing out. The CD keeps skipping and the surface looks pitted and worn :-(. It was one of the first CD's I ever bought. Does this imply that CD's have a shelf life of about 20 years or do I just not take enough care?

Anyone want to buy me a Christmas present?
