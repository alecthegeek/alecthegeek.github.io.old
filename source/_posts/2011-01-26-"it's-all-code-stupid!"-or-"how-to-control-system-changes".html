I saw a headline the other day, "Infrastructure as code", in a devops context and my immediate reaction was "but doesn't everyone do that?". I thought it might be useful to articulate some of the simple principles and benefits that underpin this approach. In this post I am talking about changes that are not part of application code, examples include: database schema upgrades; OS patches; updates to application configuration files; application deployment; OS deployment; virtual machine provisioning and management; network configuration (devices and computers).

Benefits:
<ol>
	<li>Automation: Reduces errors, improves productivity and enhances job satisfaction</li>
	<li>Change Control: Supports governance processes and assists with forensic analysis</li>
</ol>
Principles:
<ol>
	<li>Changes are applied by scripts or specified in appropriate data files (e.g. SQL scripts, Chef recipes, XML data files)</li>
	<li>All changes are applied the same way to pre-production testing and production.</li>
	<li>Scripts and data files are maintained in a version control and are subject to change control.</li>
</ol>
Changes to systems and infrastructure can now be approved and managed in the same way as changes to applications. Note that this does <em>not</em> govern management of uncontrolled changes (change auditing and remediation) which is needed to complete the circle.

What if changes cannot be automated? There are some circumstances where technology constraints (or occasionally process requirements) make manual activity necessary.:
<ol>
	<li>Look for a technology solution. e.g. running the process via a GUI testing framework such as HMTL::Mechanize</li>
	<li>Create a detailed run sheet and check list, to represent the activity, that is maintained as an artefact  (consider scanning in the completed check list to be  attached to the change record)</li>
</ol>
