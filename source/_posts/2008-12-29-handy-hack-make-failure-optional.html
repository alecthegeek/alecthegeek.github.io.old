When programming it's always a good idea to check return status to make that no error has occured. In Perl we often write

<code>somethingWeWantToDo or die "we failed because .....";
</code>
However when running in a test environment we may not have all our infrastructure in place to make our operation pass when needed (ideally we should use<a title="Mock Objects" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object" target="_blank"> mock objects</a> or some other testing framework). AÂ  hack is to pass a flag into the program telling it that we are running in a test jig and we don't care if our operation fails. The solution is simple, but a pain to work out after lunch...

<code>somethingWeWantToDo or $testJig or die "we failed because .....";</code>

If we fail and we are not using our test jig then we will exit with the appropriate diagnostics. i.e. failure is optional in a test jig

This is much easier than cluttering the code with conditonal if statements.
