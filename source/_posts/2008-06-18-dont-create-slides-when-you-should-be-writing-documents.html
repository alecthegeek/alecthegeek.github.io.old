<a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2006/04/slideuments_and.html">Presentation Zen: "Slideuments" and the catch-22 for conference speakers</a>
<blockquote>insisting that presenters submit their "PowerPoint slides" for inclusion in a future conference booklet or future download from the conference website, conference organizers force their speakers into a catch-22 situation. The presenter must say to herself: "Do I design visuals that clearly support my live talk or do I create slides that more resemble a document to be read later?"</blockquote>
I think Garr is being rather charitible. At work I am increasingly being given slides deques when I should be getting documents and it seems to be for the following reasons:
<ul>
	<li>If I write a document then that will require the generation of substantive content. However people don't expect many words on a presentation slide</li>
	<li>Slide deques aren't proper documents so I won't have to place them under document management</li>
	<li>I know I'll need to stand up and present this stuff sometime so I'll write the material once (see above)</li>
</ul>
So how do you fix this?
<ol>
	<li>Plan and structure your document (if PowerPoint works for you here fine)</li>
	<li>Write the document using the appropriate text or word-processing tools</li>
	<li>Create the presentation from the structure and content of the full paper</li>
</ol>
