I was trawling through the flickr photos for last year's OSDC and discovered that I had been caught red handed writing my <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/12/08/slides-and-example-scripts/">material </a> at the last minute.

I was a late fill in and had spend all my time writing a flashy demo, the slides then had to be written at the last minute so I missed a lot of the papers.

What was really frustrating was that laptop dual head mode did not work when I got to the presentation room and I had only my slides to present using a borrowed Mac, so no  flashy demo.

I don't intend for any of that to happen this year!
