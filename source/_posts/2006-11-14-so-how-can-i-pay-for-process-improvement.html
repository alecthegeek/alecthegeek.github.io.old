A frequent lament of process improvement champions is that management will not support the costs or show the support required. In my previous <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/11/13/what-is-process-improvement/">post</a> Bill comented that the purpose of process is reduce variability and improve consistancy.

This is of course quite correct, but not the complete story that we present to management when asking for real money and time to implement process improvement. We need to show $ value for the our activity, so we need to dig behind the quality message and provide simple metrics that show the current cost of our process, and project the savings and additional value we can achieve by investing in improvment.

You'd better start gathering those <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/10/25/useful-metrics/">metrics</a> and instrumenting your process now!
