<blockquote cite="http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/services/eat.html">The Easy Access Training program is a way for individual developers to get access to training on their own time, at relatively low cost. Courses are run on weekends, we use suburban venues, and where required we ask people to bring their own laptops. We also have an unusual approach to pricing! </blockquote><p class="citation"><cite><a href="http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/services/eat.html">Cogent Consulting Services</a></cite></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/blogs/steveh/">Steve Hayes</a> from <a href="http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/">Cogent</a> proposes a novel approach to offering training courses. I went to a short presenation he gave at <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/melbourne_XP_enthusiasts/">MXPEG</a> earlier in the month and he is very good, so this could be a chance to snap up some great training at an affordable price.</p>
