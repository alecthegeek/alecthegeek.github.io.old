Ever since I arrived in Australia eight years ago I made sure I passed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tebbit_test">Tebbit Test</a> and much to the surprise of my Australian friends and colleagues I have been a firm Australia supporter.<br /><br />I also follow the state religion, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Australian_rules_football">Australian rules</a> football (footy), and support the <a href="http://westernbulldogs.com.au/">Western Bulldogs</a> -- because someone told me they were from the wrong side of town and a bit rough.
