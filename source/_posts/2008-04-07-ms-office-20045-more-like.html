There have been two improvements:<br /><ol><li>When replying to messages the fonts don't become so small that you can't read them</li><br /><li>I can check colleagues diaries when booking a meeting</li></ol><br />And that's it!<br />Personally I am pretty disappointed and look forward to ditching Office in the next couple of weeks
