I've placed another presentation online that I gave to <a title="Linux Users of Victoria home page" href="http://www.luv.asn.au/" target="_blank">Linux Users of Victoria</a>. It's a short and very basic introduction to make (as used by software developers).

[slideshare id=640789&amp;doc=basicmake-1223370941282683-8&amp;w=425]

If you are intrested in make then you maight also like my <a title="Building Software Under Configuration Control presentation" href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/12/08/slides-and-example-scripts/" target="_blank">presentation</a> on using make and subversion together. (Beware that it's a lot more meaty than this short introduction).
