Nigel Thorne reports significant productivty gains when using Subversion

<a href="http://www.nigelthorne.com/blog/2007/05/svn-vs-clearcase.html">Search for Simplicity: SVN vs ClearCase</a>
<blockquote>swapped over from using <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/clearcase/">ClearCase</a> and <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/clearquest/">ClearQuest</a> to using <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">SVN</a></blockquote>
I would be interested to know if he uses a ticket tracking system as part of the process to replace ClearQuest-- but I can't leave comments to ask him :-(.
