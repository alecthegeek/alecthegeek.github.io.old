<a href="http://www.lulu.com/"><br /><img src="http://static.lulu.com/images/logo_lulu.gif" alt="Lulu.com - Self Publishing - Free" align="right" /></a><p> I came across a really intretsing web site the other day called <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">Lulu</a>, a commercial site that allows you to publish and sell books (and other media). It is intresting for two reasons:<br /></p><ul><li>What it allows you do by creating small print runs. e.g. create documentation for your product, print internal process manuals, etc. Prices seem resonable -- I would be intrested to know at what point it becomes cheaper to use a traditional printer.<br /></li><li>How the website is designed. It's easy to use, has a clear product message and is well layed out</li></ul><p>It was a very 'obvious' web site, even though the service being offered is quite complex.</p>powered by <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">performancing firefox</a>
