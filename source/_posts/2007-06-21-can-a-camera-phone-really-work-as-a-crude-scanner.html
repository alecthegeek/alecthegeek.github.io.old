I tried a little experiment to see how well my new camera works as a document scanner. This is a brain dump I did a few months on Application Development issues.

I suspect the result is useful for no one but me, on the grounds that I am the only one who can read my own writing. However the general technique does seem useful as I now have a easy way to make a quick record which can then be transcribed into a readable document. If you view the Flickr large size then it's readable (at least for me)

The paper is approx A5 size (it's actually a Moleskine page)

Mike Elgan has various other <a href="http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/columns/executive_tech/article.php/3679111">suggestions</a> as well for using a camera phone
