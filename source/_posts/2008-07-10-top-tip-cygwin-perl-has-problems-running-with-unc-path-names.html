When running Cygwin Perl using libraries that live on <a title="What is UNC?" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#Uniform_Naming_Convention" target="_blank">UNC</a> paths (e.g. when running prove with the -l option) Perl will croak because it is unable to load the library. An example error message will look something like:

<code>t/00.load.............Can't open perl script ""-I//server/sharename/work/mymodule/lib"": No such file or directory</code>

The fix is to map the UNC path to a drive letter and use the Cygwin mount point (e.g. '/cygdrive/z/work/mymodule') as the path instead.

The command is

<code>net use z: '\\server\sharename'</code>
