Mac OS/X 10.5 (a.k.a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Leopard</a>) sports a new backup program called <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html">TimeMachine</a>. However I am fast coming to the conclusion that it's pretty useless and you are better off with a backup script.

The problem seems to be the user interface, visiually attractive but it has no way to easily identify files and changes as the presentation is time base. i.e. it is possible to go back to a certain time, but no look at when a file (or group of files) has changed.

Usually when I want to restore something I want to locate an object and then perhaps look at it's history. No the other way around.
