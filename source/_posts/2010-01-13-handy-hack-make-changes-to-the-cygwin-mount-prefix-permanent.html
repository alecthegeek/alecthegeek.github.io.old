If you're like me then the one of the first things you do after installing <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> is to issue the command <code>mount -c /</code> so that mounts appear directly under / instead of <code>/cygdrive</code>. However the recent upgrade to Cygwin DLL means that this change is no longer persistent. In order to make it permanent you need to edit the file <code>/etc/fstab</code> and add a line
<pre>none /  cygdrive binary,posix=0,user 0 0</pre>
