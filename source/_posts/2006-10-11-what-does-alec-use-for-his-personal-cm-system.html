I know this is a question that has been keeping people awake at night, so now I will reveal what the Fat Geek uses.

I use <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion </a>and <a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/">SVK </a>for version control. I <a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/?SingleUserSVKWithARemoteSVN">explained </a>on the SVK website how I use them together, however as SCM practitionares will know, version control is not enough. We also need Control, Accounting and Auditing.

Well I side step this because:
<ul>
	<li>It's only me and my work to manage</li>
	<li>I use a variation of the <a href="http://utilware.com/gsd3.html">GSD</a> system to track what I am doing and keep my change records. It has the strong benefit of working well in my distributed environment, plus it's a single system for all of my information.</li>
</ul>
Pretty light weight, but so far it's worked well. What I Think I want is a distributed <a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt/">RT</a> system that works in the same way as SVK, but that is for another day.
