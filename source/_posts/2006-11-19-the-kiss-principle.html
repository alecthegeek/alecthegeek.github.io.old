A lot of the things I have been writing about in the last few weeks that relate to process re-enforce my strong belief in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_Principle" target="_blank">KISS principle</a> (Keep It Simple Stupid!). The <a href="http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,1540,2058194,00.asp">story</a> that Britan has apparently wasted US$ 24 Billion speaks volumes about our ability to over commit time and time again on outrageously large projects:
<blockquote>In 2002, the British government embarked on a $12 billion effort to transform its health-care system with information technology. But the country's oversight agency now puts that figure at $24 billion, and two Members of Parliament say the project is "sleepwalking toward disaster."</blockquote>
That someone decided to approve this in the first place is either:
<ul>
	<li>Hubris</li>
	<li>Stupidy</li>
	<li>Proof that the more over ambitious and ridiculous your proposal then the easier it is to get a huge budget</li>
</ul>
The world is mad!
