<a href="http://osia.net.au/">Open Source Industry Australia</a> were kind enough to invite me to present last week on pre-sales demonstrations techniques. My main message was about delivering a Value based message -- which is explained rather well by the following

<blockquote>Here’s what decision makers care about:

* Improved Revenues
* Lowered Expenses
* Efficiency of Operations
* Managed Risk</blockquote>
As well as talking about a Value based approach I also added in some general tips. Enjoy, and of course feedback is always welcome.
