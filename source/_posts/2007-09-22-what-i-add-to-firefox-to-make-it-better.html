One of the first things I install on any new machine is Firefox (Linux of course usually has it already). However afterÂ  have done that there a couple of extentions I always add
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.scribefire.com/">Scribefire</a> for blog posting</li>
	<li><a href="http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/bookmarks/quicktour">Del.icio.us </a>extension -- rather complicated but I love the sidebar</li>
</ol>
I also always try and remember to change the download location before my desktop get's too cluttered.
