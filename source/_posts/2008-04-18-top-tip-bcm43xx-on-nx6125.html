Note that there seems to be a lot a variation in peoples' experience -- you would probably be advised to slaughter a chicken and sprinkle the warm blood over your laptop first (it can't hurt)<br />ndiswrapper<br />I used the ndiswrapper route as the native OSS driver did not work for me. Also note that I am running <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> (<a href="http://www.kubuntu.org/">kubuntu</a>)<br /><br /><br /><ol><li>Download the latest driver package from hp.com. NB This is distributed as a Windows exe file but you can extract it using wine (<code>sudo apt-get install wine</code>), the file will end up in somewhere like <code>~/.wine/drive_c/SWSetup/SP34152A/</code></li><li>Make sure the native driver is disabled (instructions on URL above)</li><li>Run <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/">ndiswrapper</a> -i ... (as explained in URL above) but use the HP driver package you downloaded</li><li>In System settings/Network settings/ make sure the eth1 interface is configured for dhcp and then disabled.</li><li>Install <a href="http://kwifimanager.sourceforge.net/">KWiFiManager</a></li><li> Use kWifi Manager to confgure your WiFi connection and then activate it.</li></ol>Please note that I did not follwo such a direct route so I have limited confidence this would work exactly as documented. I took me 3 days of fiddling around so please be patient.
