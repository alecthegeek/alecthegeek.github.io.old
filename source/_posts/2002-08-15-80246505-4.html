Got chatting to Graham last night after many years -- nice to catch up on what is happening in his life. Even got a picture of him and his boyfriend (never meet him), good to see him looking so happy.

Mind you the bastard gets to go to good pubs with decent ale, I'm fed up with shitty Australia beer. Even the really good ones (e.g. Coopers) lack character

Customer problems to sort out today so early start. Could do with another hours sleep :-(. Have a stinking cold (thanks kids), Jack has a nasty ankle sprain -- although it seems a little better this morning and he is off to school.
