Well the proposal count for <a href="http://osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a> 07 seems to be at 99 (their web site is not very secure!)

Assuming eight papers a day (which is probably too many) in three streams plus keynotes they would appear to have more papers than they need -- which is very good news. Perhaps we will get a fourth stream?

I have not looked at how many of the 99 are tutorials, which take place on a fourth day so my numbers are slightly askew.

Wonder if <a href="http://osdc2007.cgpublisher.com/proposals/23">I</a> will be accepted...
