A process that is not documented can be very hard to talk about, agree and improve.</blockquote><br />Following on from a brief twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/alecthegeek/statuses/852491040">conversation</a> with <a href="http://www.carruthk.blogspot.com/">Kate</a> this morning here is a simplistic <a href="http://alecclews.pbwiki.com/LightweightProcessDocumenation#Example">example</a> of how I currently document processes. The motivation for this approach is:<br /><ul><li>Simple to edit and and maintain</li><li>I hope simple to read and understand (even if you are not technical)<br /></li><li>Can be used as the basis for detailed work instructions<br /></li></ul>
