<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000121">This</a> article touches on the patent issues of the <a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/microsoft/faq.html">deal </a>and raises some issues of concern and interest.
<ul>
	<li>Is Novell violating the GPL?</li>
	<li>What the hell happens in five years time when the deal is over</li>
	<li>Is Microsoft still trying to spread FUD about Open Source, this time using patents</li>
	<li>Can we expect the FSF to take Novell to court over the possible GPL issues</li>
</ul>
I am also intrested in the role of <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/xen/">Xen </a>in Mircosoft's plans -- more on that later
