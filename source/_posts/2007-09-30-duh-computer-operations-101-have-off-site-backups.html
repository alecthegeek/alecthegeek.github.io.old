<br /><br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7019644.stm">BBC NEWS | Entertainment | Coppola plea after computer theft</a> <br /> <blockquote>Film director Francis Ford Coppola has appealed for the return of his computer backup device following a robbery at his house</blockquote><br />It would appear that Mr Coppola did not have an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-site_Data_Protection">offsite backup</a> for his computer data. So when the robbers came they stole the laptop AND the backup. He would have had the same problem if there had been a fire or any other disaster.<br /><br />I personally have a remote version repository which backs up my work, I keep copies of all my email on the mail servers and every so often I burn stuff such as photos onto DVD.<br /><br />"Let's be careful out there"<br /><br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p>
