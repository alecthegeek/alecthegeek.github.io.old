<blockquote>Australia's Geekiest Man</blockquote>
Slashdot identified our very own Jonathan Oxer as Australia's Geekiest Man, a well deserved honour and it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.

Now we need to know who Australia's Geekiest Woman is. Possibly <a href="http://infotrope.net/blog/">Kirrily</a>, although she recently moved to San Francisco so I don't know if she still qualifies.

Updated: In early March Jon made it onto Australian <a href="http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/b/sunrise/5726/geek-goes-cyborg-implanting-ideas-at-home">national TV</a>
