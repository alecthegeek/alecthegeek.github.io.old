Nothing much to do with software, except we did talk about software, however today I got to drink at the <a href="http://www.maltshovel.com.au/brewhouse.asp?Melbourne=true">Malt and Shovel</a> brew pub (famous for their James Squire beers) for the first time. Most enjoyable, thanks to Michael, Ferdi and Dom.
