I often enjoy watching <a href="http://www.gordonramsay.com/corporate/theman/biography/">Gordon Ramsay'</a>s <a href="http://www.channel4.com/food/on-tv/ramsays-kitchen-nightmares/">Kitchen Nightmares</a> and I've wondered if his approach could be used to illustrate common problems with software development.
<ol>
	<li>Know what your customers want and will pay for: i.e. Get the requirements right</li>
	<li>Lack of training and experience can be fatal
<ul>
	<li>Don't expect kids with 6 months experience in only one language to implement large complex systems without significant supervision and mentoring</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>There is no substitute for passion and hard work</li>
	<li>Success comes from the whole team working together</li>
	<li>Keep things as simple as possible</li>
	<li>Ensure equipment is clean, working and eliminate 'bad smells' from the materials
<ul>
	<li>Version control</li>
	<li>Build environment</li>
	<li>Refactor</li>
	<li>Test planning and infrastructure...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
Some come on people, it's not exactly fucking rocket science is it?

Update June 2008 -- It appears I'm not the first to have made this <a title="Gordon Ramsay On Software" href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0103955/categories/stupidHumanProgramming/2006/07/04.html" target="_blank">connection</a>, and <a title="Gordon Ramsay is a great consultant" href="http://www.gurtle.com/ppov/2008/02/04/gordon-ramsey-is-a-great-consultant/" target="_blank">again</a>
