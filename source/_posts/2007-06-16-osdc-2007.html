The <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/index.html">Open Source Developers Conference</a> 2007 call for papers has gone out and I have just submitted my paper <a href="http://osdc2007.cgpublisher.com/proposals/23">proposal</a>. Now all I need to do it write the paper and set up the demo's... (if I get accepted)
