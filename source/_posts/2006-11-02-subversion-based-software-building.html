I am in the process of designing a mechanism to build software from a Subversion branch/tag under strict CM control and hopefully track the build output and preserve them in Subversion as well.

The draft paper is up at <a href="http://alecclews.pbwiki.com/SubversionBuilding">http://alecclews.pbwiki.com/SubversionBuilding</a>. Please feel free to come along and add comments
