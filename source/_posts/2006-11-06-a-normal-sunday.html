In order to make readers in the northern hemisphere jealous about the
great weather, and make it appear that I do really have a normal life,
I thought I would post news of our Sunday here in Melbourne.

First it's a lovely sunny day today but only 21C so wonderfully cool.
This evening we are having a barbecue after visiting our local butcher
-- lamb steaks, chicken and sausages. See the BBQ in the attached
photograph.

All washed down with local beer and wine! Australia -- bloody nice one
day, perfect the next.

We also ordered our Christmas turkey which will also go on the BBQ,
which usually means we eat about 4:30 on Christmas day as it takes so long to cook
