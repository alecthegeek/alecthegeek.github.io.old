<blockquote>Although the POSIX interface is provided, some additional interfaces like POSIX shared memory or semaphores are still under development.  All this applies to the current development version, and not to the last release (0.2). We encourage everybody who is interested to try out the latest development version, and send feedback to the Hurd developers.</blockquote>
Hurd has been under development sinse about 1990, surely it's time to do the decent thing and put it down (or is it already dead)?
