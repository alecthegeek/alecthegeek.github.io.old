<blockquote>research suggests those using Facebook come from wealthier homes and are more likely to attend college.  By contrast, MySpace users tend to get a job after finishing high school rather than continue their education.</blockquote>
I have membership of both sites and it's interesting that in a short space of time I have 14 friends on facebook, most of whom found me and only two on myspace who I sought out.

I also found myspace to be a better user experience (better UI design and more in the default set up).

In both cases I created the accounts to better understand Web 2.0 and how my children might handle it.
