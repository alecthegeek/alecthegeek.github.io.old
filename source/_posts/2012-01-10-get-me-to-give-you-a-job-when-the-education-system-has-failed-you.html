NB A lot of this post is heavily biased because of my experience in the software industry. However I think the principles have general applicability, to a greater or lesser extend, in many other fields.

There is a lot of discussion about how the current western inspired education system, still trying to extricate itself from the legacy of its 18th century foundation, is failing to provide students with the skills they need in the modern era. Also many managers like myself, who are trying to recruit "talent" (a hateful modern HR euphemism for people with skills), are gnashing our teeth in frustration trying to find people with skills and passion to enable the success of our organisations.

So the question is how to connect people with jobs to the people who can do them? i.e. How do you, as a recent student with limited academic credentials, persuade me that we should work together?

Firstly what are the skills and attributes that organisations look for?
<ul>
	<li>Basic literacy, numeracy and technology understanding.</li>
	<li>Technical skills such as <a title="Explanation of STEM" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields" target="_blank">STEM</a>, finance, law, medicine etc.</li>
	<li>The ability to collaborate</li>
	<li>Creativity</li>
	<li>Flexibility</li>
	<li>Passion</li>
</ul>
A lot of this is also driven by your personal values, sense of personal curiosity and other personal traits.

Traditionally students have worked diligently to obtain pieces of paper that attest (directly or indirectly) to one or more of these attributes. If you had a first class degree in computer science and I liked you at interview it was likely I'd feel comfortable about giving you a job as a junior developer. However that model always was flawed and is becoming ore flawed over time. Why is that?

It fails to show how well you collaborate, your personal motivation beyond the requirements of the course, your passion or indeed many other intrinsic skills and attributes. Hiring managers would often look at membership and leadership rolls in the educational organisation for hints about these attributes but fundamentally the academic qualification is very limited as tool -- but there was not much else. One of the biggest flaws was that such a system failed to identify many talented individuals who failed to meet the narrow criteria that the system measures and this problem is getting worse as technology fundamently shifts the way we work. Sir Ken Robinson articulates this very well.

So if you are a recent student who has not got what you apparently need from the academic production line what can you do?
<ol>
	<li>Recognise that personal development and satisfying your passion is a long process. It's the journey that matters, not the destination</li>
	<li>Understand that not knowing your passion or having clarity about your goals is normal.  It's also OK to change them (sometimes often). Again it's the journey</li>
	<li>You need to eat and satisfy your basic needs (and remember most needs are basic -- live a frugal lifestyle) so get a job even if it's not what you want to do. It will not be for ever</li>
	<li>Get yourself a basic computer and internet access. These need not need be expensive</li>
	<li>Start teaching yourself</li>
	<li>Start pursing your interets</li>
	<li>Write a blog about what you are doing</li>
	<li>Engage in the communities around what your current interests are. Remember that communities exist both on the internet and locally , join both</li>
	<li>Travel if possible</li>
	<li>Grab opportunities and take risks, but be patient as sometimes they can take months or years to come</li>
	<li>Apply for jobs (perhaps waiting 6-12 months in the 1st instance)</li>
</ol>
For instance. You live in Melbourne, Australia, and want to become a software developer but have only done a secondary course on computers at school which was stifling. You are lucky because you can live at home and already have a computer. You can attend many local technical user groups -- they are all free and a few months attending the various talks and networking is time well spent. You can enrol in the many free open courseware (for example the <a title="Machine Learning Class website" href="http://www.ml-class.org/course/auth/welcome" target="_blank">Machine Learning</a> course from Stanford), if your maths is weak you can improve it at the Khan Academy.
