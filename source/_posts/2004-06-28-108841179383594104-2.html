Started reading <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/entjbeans3/index.html"> "Enterprise Java Beans "</a> only to discover that the fourth edition is due for release this month :-(. Books are expensive in Australia, this one was A$130, and it's already out of date .... It was still worth getting though, very useful.
