The BBC reports good things about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/2655127.stm">Mickey Mouse</a> degrees.

However at the risk of seeming rather <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=define%3Acurmudgeonly%2C&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official">curmudgeonly</a>, I have to say that the problem is not that specific undergraduate courses are poor but that the whole academic system seems to have removed the most valuable parts of the tertiary education process. Namely the teaching of research techniques and core concepts. Most of the graduates I recruit or work with are not widely read.

The current ethos seems to be to present students with prepared learning material, heaven forbid the little dears should have to visit the library, and make sure that the 'clients' are not unduly challenged by the assessment process so that they remain as 'happy customers' --education delivered with the integrity of <a href="http://mcdonalds.com/">McDonald's</a>. Perhaps all degrees should be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_University">Hamburgerology</a>
