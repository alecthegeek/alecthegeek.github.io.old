<a href="http://www.computermath.com/index.php">Computer Math</a> <br /> <blockquote>Computer Math</blockquote>I found this site, which has <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/">AlecTheGeek</a> linked in their blogroll -- many thanks for that. The site is a set of personnel technical notes and seems to be focused on software building and deployment. There is a lot of basic information, but it needs expanding with more personnel experience I think -- could have lots of potential.<br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p>
