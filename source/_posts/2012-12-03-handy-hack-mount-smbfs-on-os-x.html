I have a series of SMB shares that I mount manually when I'm at the office and I had written a helper script that used the OS X <code>open</code> command to mount the file systems. This worked fine and the credentials were stored in the Key Chain to no further action was required. However the open command then open a new OS X Finder window and destroyed my command line fu -- I had to flip back to my iTerm2 window which was irritating me each time.

The alternative was to use the mount command, which was documented to support a <code>-N</code> option to read credentials from <code>~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf</code>. However I could not get this to work and it appears that many other people had problems.

It is easy to use the mount command and supply the credentials as follows
``` bash
mount -t smbfs //$user:$password@$server/$sharename /Volumes/$sharename
```
With the appropriate values and the <code>/Volumes/$sharename</code> directory already created. So I wipped up a quick script so make it all automatic.
