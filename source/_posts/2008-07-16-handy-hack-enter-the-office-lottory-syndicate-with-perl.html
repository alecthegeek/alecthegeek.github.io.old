If you are asked to chose numbers for a lottery here is a rather inelegant hack to create some entries. Assume you need x numbers from a range of a to b inclusive then run this program as

<code>./lottery.pl  a b x</code>.

``` perl
#! /usr/bin/perl
#

our %dup;

our $lower = $ARGV[0];
our $upper = $ARGV[1];
our $needed = $ARGV[2];

for (1..$needed) {
    my $x = int(rand($upper-1)+$lower);
    if ($dup{$x}) { redo }
    print  "$x \n";
    $dup{$x}++;
}
```
