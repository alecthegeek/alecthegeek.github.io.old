Andrew <a href="http://aabs.wordpress.com/2006/12/05/dodgy-postmodernist-analysis/#respond">suggests</a> that people like me who dislike Microsoft are doing it for reasons of juvenile jealousy. Speaking for myself that's actually completely wrong, I dislike Microsoft because:
<ul>
	<li>Their attempt to force Windows adoption by releasing compilers with no MS DOS support long before Windows became a standard PC platform and there were still many, many, DOS users.</li>
	<li>The way they treated Stac Electronics in the '90s</li>
	<li>The poor quality of MS operating systems, IMHO it was not until Windows 2000 that Windows became of just about usable quality</li>
	<li> The fact that so much data is locked up in secret MS Office file formats</li>
	<li>and so on...</li>
</ul>
Once upon Bill Gates was someone I admired, but then I grew up. BTW, I am neither a graduate or young (unfortunately)
