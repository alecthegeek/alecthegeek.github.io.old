I have just spent far more time than I should discovering the correct way to disable my caps lock key on GNOME with Linux. So here is the secret sauce:

The command you need to run is <code>xmodmap -e "remove lock = Caps_Lock"</code> which you can place in your <code>~/.profile</code>, which is usually run as part of the {k,g,x}dm startup scripts (although your mileage may vary depending on how your system is set up). Thanks to <a href="http://www.peterbe.com/">Peter </a>for the <a href="http://www.peterbe.com/Disable-Caps-Lock-in-Linux">tip</a>

In Ubunto <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/news/610released">6.10</a> (and above) using  GNOME <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gdm/">GDM</a> there is a better way. Create a file called <code>~/.Xmodmap</code> that contains the text <code>remove lock = Caps_Lock</code> and restart X. This should work in other distros using GNOME, I examined the file <code>/etc/gdm/Xsession</code> to locate this information, there may be a KDE equivalent. When switching from GNOME to <a title="Xfce Desktop environment" href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a> the setting is also picked up.

Update June 2008 -- tested on Hardy Heron 8.04 and works as discussed. Gnome now asks you to confirm that you want the .Xmodmap used the first time, then it's automatic.

In MS Windows there are various registry files to accomplish the same task -- just ask Google, but inspect any registry file you download in a text editor to make sure it looks like it's only doing what it's supposed to.
