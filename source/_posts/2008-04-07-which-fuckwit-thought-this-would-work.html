<br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7328170.stm">BBC NEWS | UK | Sex offenders face website bans</a> <br /> <blockquote>Sex offenders' e-mail addresses are to be passed to social networking sites like Facebook and Bebo to prevent them contacting children.</blockquote><br />As a parent of two young children and someone who has worked with survivors of childhood sexual assult in the past I am 150% behind measures that will provide protection to the young. However someone needs to educate polititions on what is effective, as opposed to measures designed to chase votes and lull people into a false sense of security.<br /><br />All measures such as filtering, blocking email addresses etc. can be easily circumnavigated. They only effective protection is  to physically ensure the children are safe at the point of delivery (i.e. the child's computer). In the same way I don't let my young children wander onto the road or alone into potentially risky situations, I make sure that I know (see) what they are doing online and educate them on safe internet practices.<br /><br />As you can tell naive ideas as the one outlined above annoy me intensely.<br /><br />
