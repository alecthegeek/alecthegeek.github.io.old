I just notice that Mozilla <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird's</a> new calendar extension, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/">Lightning</a> has been released (well 0.3 anyway). As a <a href="//wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Productivity_pr0n">productivity pr0n</a> additct I am looking forward to kicking the tyres. However first I will have to build it for my 64 bit platform, but it's too far down my list of <a href="http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Next_Action">next actions</a>
