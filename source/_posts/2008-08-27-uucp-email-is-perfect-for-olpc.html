I sometimes wonder why people with poor or limited network connections don't still use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP">UUCP</a> email. It can be configured to use precious bandwidth during off-peak times, handles slow networks and unreliable communication. This would seem to be the perfect piece of infrastructure to be rolled out with the <a title="One Laptop Per Child project" href="http://laptop.org/laptop/" target="_blank">OLPC</a> project. If your network does not have a wired connection to the world is even works over HF radio.

All you have to remember is that email is not an instant messaging medium.
