Well a few days ago I <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/11/03/holy-cow-novell-and-microsoft/"> wondered</a> about the newly announced <a href="http://www.novell.com/news/press/item.jsp?id=1196">alliance</a> between <a href="http://www.novell.com/">Novell</a> and <a href="http://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>. Now that some of the dust is settling down I am a little disappointed in Novell. One item that particularly caught my attention was the promised improvement for <a href="http://openoffice.org/">Open Office</a> interoperability. It appears that the plan is to write filters so that Open Office can read and write Microsoft's new <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/">ECMA</a> approved   <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/news/TC45_current_work/TC45-2006-50.htm">Office Open XML</a> format. What is wrong with the ISO approved <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office#overview">Open Document Format</a> is a mystery to me.

Given our <a href="http://www.research.att.com/%7Ebs/uk-objections.pdf">experience</a> with Microsoft and their sponsorship of C++/CLI at ECMA, in my opinion an attempt to foist .NET into the C++ community, the prospect of supporting MS Office in it's continuing dominance fills with me disgust.

I suspect I will be migrating from <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Welcome_to_openSUSE.org">OpenSUSE</a> to <a href="http://www.us.debian.org/">Debian</a> or <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubunto</a> soon.
