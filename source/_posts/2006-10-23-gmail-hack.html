Like a lot of Geeks I have a <a href="http://gmail.com/">Gmail</a> account and love the searching power it has. On my laptop I have the excellent <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> MUA with the <a href="http://www.longshot.com/%7Ekmixter/gmailui.html">GMailUI</a> extension. However it's not as good as GMail for searching all my email very quickly.

That would be not a problem if I only had one email account, but I have three in active use. So I have devised this little hack to have the power of Gmail search across all my accounts.
<ul>
	<li>Set up Thunderbird to BCC my Gmail account with a custom Gmail address, e.g. alecthegeek+othermail@gmail.com when I send email from my othermail@myotheraccount mail account.</li>
	<li>Then set up a Gmail filter so that anything from othermail@myotheraccount is archived and has a label applied so that I do not get my Gmail inbox cluttered up.</li>
	<li>Create a filter in Thunderbird  that deletes all GMail where the Deliver-To field is alecthgeek+othermail@gmail.com. Thunderbird is still keeping a copy of my sent emails in my Sent email folder of course, but does not clutter up my local inbox with copies of emails I sent that got blind copied to Gmail.</li>
</ul>
The downside is that you are giving Google even more information about yourself and what you do :-(
