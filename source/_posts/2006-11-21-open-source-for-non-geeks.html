My colleague <a href="http://headwestsimon.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Simon</a>, who is self confessed <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/S/suit.html" target="_blank">suit</a>-compliant human, was pleased to be able to install our <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php" target="_blank">Open source</a> <a href="http://headwestsoftware.com/products/alm_suite.html" target="_blank">product</a> without problems in an hour on our server.

I think this illustrates a trend that has been evident for some time -- Open source software is now  ready for the mainstream and can be used by anyone. To be sure there are bad examples of the art, however that applies across the whole software industry unfortunatly.

Can world domination be far away? :-).
