<blockquote>why Mac users are a bunch of wallies</blockquote>
Well we went out and bought an iMac for the family, to replace the Windows XP system that was showing his age, so now we have joined the army of Mac wallies.

It 's a sweet machine though and so far the missus has found it easier to switch from Windows to OS/X than moving from IE6 to IE7. Go figure!

(Updated --  I would however like to point out that personnally I still continue to use Linux on my laptop, "Mac is just for the kids you understand")
