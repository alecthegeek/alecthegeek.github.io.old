Arrh!! For the second time in a week I have doubled booked myself :-(.

I need an alternative calendar system. Currently I use the daily pages in my journal to make a diary note.  However this does not seem to be working well anymore. I think a combination of not being able to read my own writing and not copying family appointments into my journal are the main reason.

I have also have access to Google <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/" title="Google Calendar" target="_blank">Calendar </a>and a <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/" title="Zimbra" target="_blank">Zimbra </a>Calendar. However they are on  servers and I want something I can carry and use off-line. Since my Windows PDA does not sync with my Linux software I feel very stuck.

When I was  using MS <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/default.aspx" title="Outlook" target="_blank">Outlook </a>then the PDA thing worked very well...

Anyway -- sincere apologies to those who have been inconvenienced by my lack of control and effective tools
