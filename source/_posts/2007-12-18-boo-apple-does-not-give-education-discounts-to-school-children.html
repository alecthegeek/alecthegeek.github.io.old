<br /><br /><a href="http://store.apple.com/Catalog/Australia/Images/routingpage.html">Apple Store for Education</a> <br /> <blockquote>Student<br /> University TAFE<br /> Other accredited higher education</blockquote><br />Apple gives some nice discounts to students and staff, but not to teanagers at high school (or younger). I would have thought the more they can rope in at an early age the better. At my son's school there is wall to wall Windows (except in the art department). It would be nice to see an alternative; it could also open the door to more Linux as well, once people can have a choice.<br /><br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p>
