  Last Thursday I went to the <a href="http://webstandardsgroup.org/" title="Web Standards Group">Web Standards Group</a>   meeting here in Melbourne to see the presentation given by <a href="http://adactio.com/about/" title="Jeremy Keith">Jeremy Keith</a>   on the "<a href="http://www.blackphoebe.com/msjen/archives/2006/09/the_joy_of_api.html" title="Joy of API">Joy of API</a>  ". The thrust of the talk was to outline the power of web API's, for web sites such as <a href="http://flickr.com/help/website/#181" title="flickr">flickr</a>  , <a href="http://www.amazon.com/AWS-home-page-Money/b/ref=gw_br_websvcs/002-7933277-5532842?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3435361" title="Amazon">Amazon</a>  , <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/" title="Google Maps">Google Maps</a>   etc, and how it can be used to enhance your own web sites.  The take away messages were:
<ul>
	<li>There is a lot a information and functionality you can add to your web site, that is actually provided by other people's web API's</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer" title="REST">REST</a> is better (simpler) than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP" title="SOAP">SOAP</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformats" title="Microformats">Microformats</a>   exist to make your content parse-able from other sites, this can be considered as a poor man's API enabling technology</li>
	<li>If you want to publish your own Web APIm then base it on exisiting practice (i.e copy someone else's)</li>
</ul>
