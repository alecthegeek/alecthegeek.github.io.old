I have decided that Agile is
<ol>
	<li>Grossly overused and over hyped</li>
	<li>Promoted at the single silver bullet for all projects and project problems</li>
</ol>
A lot (most) of this is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/balderdash">balderdash</a>! However an Agile approach is till useful in many situations but in an effort to avoid the Agile bandwagon I will be using the term "Appropriately Lightweight" -- more on what this might mean for developers and application lifecycle management in the ongoing blog, I have already posted some material on <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/10/27/what-is-a-lightweight-ticket-process/">lightweight ticket</a> processes previously.

Or should that be a new "buzzphrase"?
