A company I know has released a promotional video on YouTube to explain their solution space. Whilst I applaud their initiative, I can't help feeling they look like a bunch of sad 40 year olds trying to do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_%28dance%29">the twist</a> at an <a href="http://www.eminem.com/">Eminem</a> concert.

Sorry guys, a 10 for effort, but minus several million points for style

Or am I being really bitchy and unfair?
