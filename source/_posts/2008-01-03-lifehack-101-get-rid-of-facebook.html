I have decided to start 2008 by cutting out the serious waste of time that is <a href="http://facebook.com/">facebook</a>. My first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_hack">life hack</a> of 2008, I hope there are many more.

Update April 2010. You can now delete your facebook account <a href="http://www.facebook.coM/group.php?gid=16929680703">permanently</a>
