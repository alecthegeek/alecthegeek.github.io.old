<blockquote>the rumor mill churning over 3G iPhones coming soon.</blockquote>
Along with the updated software <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/iphoneroadmap/">roadmap</a> announced last month (enterprise email, SDK etc etc) the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> is starting to look like a worthwhile appliance for serious people instead of a toy for Mac <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanboy">fanboys</a> and girls. My current handset contract expires in 18 months so I'll look forward to considering it then -- provided it's arrived in Australia of course...
