<br /><a href="http://blog.businessofsoftware.org/2007/07/from-project-sl.html">Business of Software Blog: From project sluts to strawmen: An interview with Tim Lister</a> <br /> <blockquote>Cramblitt: What do you think about the reliance on best practices?<br /><br />Lister: I get chills when I hear that phrase.  From my point of view there are some pretty good practices, but no best practices because that implies generic software development. </blockquote><br />A intresting piece on patterns for project management. Makes me want to get the book.<br /><br />The reference to my old friend Peter is because he said this to me many years ago and still I cringe every time I use the phrase. Unfortunately I still use phrase because it has such a cachet. so I must be a marketing tart (when I'm not being a Geek of course)<br /><br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p>
