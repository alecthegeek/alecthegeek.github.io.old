Dimensions Build 8.0.2: How to rename a build project

1)	Rename the Build project in Build web client
2)	Edit the TGT and globally replace the old name with the new name
3)	Create a new build project in Dimensions
4)	Move the Build sub project

In the next release I am told this will easier (no need to edit the TGT files)
