For any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupie" target="_blank">groupies</a> who want to come and hang on my every word at <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/" target="_blank">OSDC</a>, my <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/11/29/i-have-subversion-based-cm-building-working/">presentation</a> has been <a href="http://osdc2006.cgpublisher.com/program.html" target="_blank">scheduled</a> for Friday (8/Dec), 11:00 in room 2.

In order to reduce the amount of clearing up could the young ladies please try and limit the number of recently worn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knickers" target="_blank">knickers</a> thrown on the stage. Thanks
