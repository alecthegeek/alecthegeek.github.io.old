<blockquote>in 100 words or less, why you are such a supporter of your chosen operating system and what features you love about it</blockquote>
<img src="http://www.cs.earlham.edu/~jeremiah/linux-pix/linuxpov_sml.gif" alt="Linux, the choice of a GNU generation" align="right" height="128" width="235" />The BBC is asking people to justify their choice of OS, and to be honest it's a hard thing to do in an objective and factual way. However let's see how I do...

Linux provides my with the most flexible and compatible platform for the type of technical software work I do. It's cheap in license fees, secure and highly functional. The are also a complete set of business and office applications to use as well.

The downside the is the extra time it takes to get hardware and gadgets to work. :-( and everyone else's' assumption that I can run Windows software or that MS Office is my native file format.
