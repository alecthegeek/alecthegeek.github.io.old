After some <a href="http://www.daniweb.com/forums/thread34512.html">information</a> from <a href="http://www.daniweb.com/forums/member8300.html">jim mcnamara</a> I developed a script to compare two directory trees. I needed something that worked on Solaris 8 so it uses basic UNIX tools (and dircmp was not very useful). If you are using a more modern system then try <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2007/11/27/handy-hack-compare-backups-with-the-original/">this</a>
