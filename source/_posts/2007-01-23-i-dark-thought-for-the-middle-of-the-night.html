As I was drifting of to sleep last I suddenly realised that next year it will be 30 years since I wrote my first computer program, a small mainframe BASIC application that printed out the multiplication tables to twelve -- no proper loops, just <code>if</code> and <code>goto</code> because that's as far as I had got in the book. I did this in sixth form at <a href="http://www.mgs.kent.sch.uk/">Maidstone Grammar School</a> just as I was starting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-level">A level</a> computer science with a new school teacher, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/timbaker">Tim Baker</a>, who as you can see has moved onto other things. I owe them, and many other people, a huge debt.

<!--more-->So what's happened over the last nearly 30 years. Here is my personal list in no particular order:
<ul>
	<li>The PC</li>
	<li>Client server computing, initially 2 tier which took a very long time to to become accepted, and then later multi-tier</li>
	<li>The drop in cost of software and hardware. Many people now have computers with complex tools (office automation, software development, multimedia....) at both home and work</li>
	<li>The Internet</li>
	<li>Free Software</li>
	<li>Web applications and the on-line economy</li>
	<li>OO technologies</li>
	<li>New languages such as:  C++, java etc; Perl, Python etc; "Interesting" languages that have become more mainstream such as Haskell, Lisp etc.</li>
	<li>Everything has become digital. Music, TV, banking, photographs, education, commerce, wars...</li>
</ul>
and what have been the disappointments?
<ul>
	<li>Software development has become a fashion industry, every new fad will fix all the problems with the previous one</li>
	<li>Stuff takes a long time to become mass marketed even when there are no technology problems</li>
	<li>It's still pretty hard for the none-technical people to get things to work</li>
	<li>The decline in the quality of computer education (or perhaps it was never very good?)</li>
</ul>
