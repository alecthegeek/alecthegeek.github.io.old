Been thinking about my requirements management tool. The problem has been about architecture. I need something that will version each requirement and support the maintainance of arbitrary links between requirements (plus other entities such as projects etc.)

The need to maintain complex links would seem to argue the use of a relational database, but the need for versions points to a version repository such as <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> with embedded html links, this implies <a href="http://webdav.org/wg/">webdav</a> or <a href="http://webdav.org/wg/#dv">Delta-V</a> server perhaps.

Problems with this
1) If I use an RDBMS then I risk locking users into a single product such Postgresql
2) There are no Delta-V servers yet

It occurs to me that I could give users the choice by hiding the implementation detail behind a design pattern. I could initially do this using Postgresql and then provide alternative  implementations if required (I can simulate versions of requirements in a DBMS)
