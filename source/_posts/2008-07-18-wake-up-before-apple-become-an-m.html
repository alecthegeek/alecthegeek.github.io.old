<blockquote>Now that there is an AppStore with applications in iTunes, why wouldn't Apple move next to distribute all applications through iTunes</blockquote>
A very cogent comment from ionix5891 on <a href="http://slashdot.org/" target="_blank">/.</a> warning us no to sleep walk into the arms of another monopoly power. As I said before, Steve Jobs can be a very scary guy!

Personally, now that <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/products/WhatIsUbuntu/desktopedition" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> 8.04 (or <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spiny+norman" target="_blank">Spiny Norman</a> as I call it) is so polished I'm not feeling such an urgent need to rush back into the arms of Cupertino. Mr <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/biography" target="_blank">Shuttleworth</a> may have made life a lot less exciting, but now it all 'just works'. Well, except for some proprietary media formats still.

Having said that, the family is still happy plugging away on the iMac (except when my son wants to run games)
