Back in November I <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/12/19/an-intresting-idea/">mentioned</a> that <a href="http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/">Cogent Consulting</a> were running <a href="http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/services/eat.htm">easy access training</a> (EAT) courses. The first was yesterday and was an exceptional workshop on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_developmen">Test Driven Development</a> (TDD). There will hopefully be further courses so I suggest you keep your eyes on the <a href="http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/services/eat.html">Cogent EAT</a> web site. There are some more pictures on Steve's <a href="http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/blogs/steveh/2007/01/first_eat_workshop.html">blog</a>.

So what did I learn about TDD and programming in general?
<ol>
	<li>TDD requires rigorous application of the write-a-test-see-it-fail-write-the-feature-see-it-pass-re-factor-and-see-it-pass coding cycle</li>
	<li>Keep a notepad handy to note down any re-factoring you see that will distract in the middle of the cycle</li>
	<li>I got some exposure to pair programming (I was paired with some more experienced folks which was a huge help because of my lack of Java/Eclipse/Agile programming skills) and found it a revelation -- made me wish I did not work on my own the whole time -- many thanks to the patient students who worked with me</li>
	<li>I understood what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_Injection">dependency injection</a> is and more importantly why we want to do it</li>
	<li>I was reminded of the importance of naming things</li>
	<li>The difference between State testing and <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/articles/129544.aspx">Interaction testing</a> (using mock objects)</li>
</ol>
Most importantly I was invigorated to be exposed to new ideas and techniques and I'm looking forward to trying TDD for some of my current Perl work. Many thanks to <a href="http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/blogs/steveh/">Steve</a> and the other attendees who helped make the day so worthwhile for me.
