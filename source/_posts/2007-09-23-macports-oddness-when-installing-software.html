(updated March 2008)

I was using <a href="http://www.macports.org/">Macports</a> to install <a href="http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/GnuCash">GNUCash</a> on my Macbook and hit a small road block which may be useful to share:

Halfway through install of glib2 my connection dropped out and the install barphed. Every time I restarted it it complained about the checksum being invalid for that package. After a lot of messing around the following two commands seemed to do the trick

<code> </code>
<pre>sudo port clean --all glib2</pre>
<ol></ol>
<ol></ol>
YMMV
