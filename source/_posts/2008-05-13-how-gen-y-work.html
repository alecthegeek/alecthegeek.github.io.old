I found <a title="The Gen Y Guide to Web 2.0 at Work" href="http://sachachua.com/wp/2008/05/09/the-gen-y-guide-to-web-20-at-work/" target="_blank">this</a> and thought of <a href="http://carruthk.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Kate</a>.

Of course if you're not some ultra hip young thing what can you do? Here are my tips on Web 2.0 for Old Farts at Work (of which I am proud to be one):
<ol>
	<li><a title="Show your worth" href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/the-easy-way-to-show-what-youre-worth/" target="_blank">Publish a weekly report</a> and show what you're achieving</li>
	<li>Get a <a title="Linked business networking site" href="http://linkedin.com/" target="_blank">LinkedIn </a>account -- it's not facebook and has a lot more gravitas; but at least you have an online presense. Spend some time making the profile reflect you and your experience</li>
	<li>Use an RSS reader (e.g. Google Reader) to read blogs and news that interest you. It saves a lot of time</li>
	<li>Start a blog -- you don't need to post every day, but it's a good place to put down all the lessons you have learned where they will be useful to others</li>
	<li>Try and stop snarling at the young people. Apparently we were like them once (so they tell me)</li>
</ol>
