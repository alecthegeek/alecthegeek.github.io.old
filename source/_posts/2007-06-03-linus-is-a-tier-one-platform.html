When looking at technologies like .NET my constant whine is that they are not cross platform unlike J2EE (I don't really consider Mono to be a full plug in replacement). i.e. .NET only runs on Windows. There are other examples of course.

However the problem runs both ways -- many tools (e.g. svn, git, GNUCash, etc) do not run as well on OS/X or Windows as they do on Linux.

For a wandering minstrel such as myself , this makes the choice of personal tools for accounting, development, etc. a curious set of compromises.

Or usually, to hell with compromise and just pick the one that looks cool on Linux (and of course <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds#The_Linus.2FLinux_connection">Linus is the father of Linux</a>)
