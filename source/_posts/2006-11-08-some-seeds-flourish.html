I was browsing <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.announce">c.o.l.a</a> this evening when I discovered that <a href="http://gllug.org.uk/">GLLUG</a> is still going strong.

<img src="http://www.gllug.org.uk/uploads/Logos/greengllug.gif" align="right" />This brings back memories as I helped start the group back in 1997, the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/uk.comp.os.linux/browse_thread/thread/595e4bb017e9ab82/b8f5189cc15b5bb6?lnk=st&amp;q=GLLUG&amp;rnum=168#b8f5189cc15b5bb6">first</a> meeting was at my then employers premises. However we had no regular place to meet for some time until <a href="http://www.gnd.com/">GND</a> very kindly <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/uk.comp.os.linux/browse_thread/thread/b360b5dfbf954a92/75aa6340107248ad?lnk=gst&amp;q=GLLUG+GND&amp;rnum=1#75aa6340107248ad">stepped</a> in and gave us a home until well after I moved to Australia.

BTW, I spent days coming up with the 'cute' name, it was a reference to the famous Linux virtual beer.

The group now has it's own web domain and meets in <a href="http://www.wmin.ac.uk/page-4459">central</a> London. Well done to Glluger's past and <a href="http://beerandspeech.org/index.php?/archives/293-GLLUGs-Intro-to-Linux-day.html">present</a> for keeping the torch burning. It can be hard work but it's an important job.
