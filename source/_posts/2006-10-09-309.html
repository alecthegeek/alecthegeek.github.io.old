Those of you who know me will be aware that I am part of <a href="http://headwestsoftware.com/executive_team.html">Head West Software</a> (scroll down to see my mug shot), a startup based in Oregon, US.  Now that we have released our first product,<a href="http://almsuite.sourceforge.net/">ALM Suite</a>, I hope to be using my blog to tell the world more about what we are doing, so expect to see more here about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Lifecycle_Management">Application Lifecycle Management</a> , running a startup and my views on software development and <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">open source</a> software.  I will of course be following the excellent <a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/blogs/policy.html">guidelines</a> from <a href="http://sun.com/">Sun </a>.
