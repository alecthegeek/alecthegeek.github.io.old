<blockquote>Agile processes are highly vulnerable to code donuts</blockquote>
Kevin articulates the unease which many people, including me sometimes, feel about agile development and the possible impact of apparently very short term design decisions. This is especially worrisome as systems become older and larger. The impact of early decisions, made with insufficient data or thought, can have  very far reaching affects that were impossible to predict when doing the test driven development (for example).

How do we overcome this?
<ol>
	<li>Follow the Agile practices. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refactor">Refactor</a> and plan that rework will be required. It's already been paid for by earlier delivery of business value.</li>
	<li>More importantly, don't be dogmatic and make sure you do <em>some </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front">Big Design Up Front</a> -- but just enough (and that's a fine line to recognise)</li>
</ol>
Nothing beats experience of course -- shame it's so expensive to get it.
