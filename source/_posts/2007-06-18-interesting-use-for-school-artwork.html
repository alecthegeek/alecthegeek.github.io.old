When you travel a lot on business it can be very tedious living in hotel rooms all the time and often there are feelings of isolation.

I sometimes take the kids artwork with me and hang it up on the mirrors etc. It makes the room a lot more homely.

And showing the kids a photograph of their artwork in your hotel room gives them a big boost.
