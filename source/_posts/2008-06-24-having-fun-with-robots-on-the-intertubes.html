The British rail system has deployed a web based interactive <a title="Lisa home page" href="http://lisa.nationalrail.co.uk/NREBot/" target="_blank">robot</a>, called Lisa, to help people with rail travel enquiries. Much innocent fun can be had if you are not busy. For example...
<blockquote>You asked:  Are you a train spotter?
Lisa says: I'm not a Train Spotter. But I do have some guidelines for railway enthusiasts, if you'd like to take a look?

You asked: Does it include how to avoid dressing in an anorak?

Lisa says: I'm afraid my specialty is travelling by train and I cannot answer questions about clothing.

You asked: But I need to meet girls and want help on how to dress

Lisa says: If you let the Train Operating Company know you'll need assistance in advance (ideally, 24 hours before), they can usually arrange for staff to meet you at your departure station, accompany you to the train and see you safely on board.</blockquote>
