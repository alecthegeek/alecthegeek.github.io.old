<a href="http://aggreg8.net/user/Profile.aspx?UserID=3774">zx12bob</a> <a href="http://aggreg8.net/blogs/software_development_management_and_process_improvement/archive/2006/11/10/wtf.aspx">asks</a> what is process and who needs it. The answer to this question is easy -- the details and implementation are of course complex, but at the highest level it comes down to three things.
<ul>
	<li>We must do things cheaper</li>
	<li>We must do things faster</li>
	<li>We must do things better</li>
</ul>
What does that mean?

<dl> <dt>Cheaper</dt> <dd>
<ul>
	<li>Use Fewer people</li>
	<li>Peform less rework (rework costs money)</li>
</ul>
</dd> <dt>Faster</dt> <dd>Offer useful business services to users as quickly as possible </dd> <dt>Better </dt> <dd>Improve the  user experience with better design and fewer bugs</dd> </dl>The way to achieve this is to have <em>everyone</em> consistantly use the best process for the project.

So now the complex questions:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/10/30/so-how-do-i-know-what-my-process-requirments-are/">What</a> is the best process</li>
	<li>How do we use it consistantly?</li>
</ul>
