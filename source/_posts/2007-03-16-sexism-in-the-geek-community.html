<br /><a href="http://www.geekosophical.net/?p=78">philosophical geekess » …hear me roar!</a> <br /> <blockquote>I’ve learned to be ‘less feminine’ in my communications</blockquote>Melissa, a local geek, has an exellent post on some of the issues on being female in the community. However the phrase above set me thinking. How do you communicate in a feminine way when discussing geek stuff? When discussing things other than technology how does it work? If you are caring or thoughtful in your posts does that make you female?<br /><br />I don't think I could detect the difference. However I am sure I could detect the difference between a jerk and thoughtful person, so men -- don't be a jerk! From Mellisa's post it would appear a lot of us still are :-(.<br /><br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">powered by <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">performancing firefox</a></p>
