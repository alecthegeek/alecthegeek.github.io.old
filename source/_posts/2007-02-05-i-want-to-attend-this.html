<a href="http://damian.conway.org/Courses//Productivity.html">Thoughtstream | Courses | The Productive Programmer</a> <br /> <blockquote>This course explores how Dr Damian Conway -- one of the most prolific contributers to the Perl community and to the CPAN -- manages to be so productive</blockquote><br />Having seen Damian present some of his ideas about productivity, both in person and in  books, I have a strong suspision this would be a very thought provoking and useful course.<br /><br />Damian gave a presentation at OSDC 2005 that showed some of his techniques, including which CPAN modules he used and how to present the writing of Perl code by using IO::Prompt (which he wrote of course), I believe there was also a more substantial presentation at OSCON. I think he uses the Vim editor so I would even more out of it.<br /><br />Generally Damian is very a) knowledgeable and b) amusing presenter so if you ever have the opportunity to hear him speak don't miss it, even if you are not a Perl programmer.<br /> <br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">powered by <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">performancing firefox</a></p>
