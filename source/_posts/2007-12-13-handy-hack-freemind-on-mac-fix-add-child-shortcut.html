The excellent <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">FreeMind</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind mapping</a> tool started to play up when I tried to use it on <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Leopard</a>. I couldn't use the keyboard to insert a new child node, a pretty basic function really. I apologise to anyone atÂ  last nights Perl Mongers meeting distrurbed by me pounding (gently) on my machine trying to make it work during the presentation, as I have taken to using Freemind for note taking.

The fix turns out to be very simple. In Tools/Preferences/Keystrokes (scroll down a little) make TAB the shortcut for 'Add Child' as well as 'Add Child Mac'
