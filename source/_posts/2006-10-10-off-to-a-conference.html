I managed to score a free ticket to <a href="http://www.thinkinglinux.com.au/ThinkingLinux/">Thinking Linux</a> here in <a href="http://www2.visitvictoria.com/displayObject.cfm/ObjectID.EC23FF99-5AE4-4C56-86BBCE92B6D361CF/lk.Menu2_1/pg.MelbGateway/vvt.vhtml">Melbourne</a>. It looks a rather low key affair and I failed to see any effective PR for the event so I am not sure what to expect.<br /><br />Ping me if you are going and perhaps we can meet up.<br /><br />I'll report next week on my impressions.<br /><br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">powered by <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">performancing firefox</a></p>
