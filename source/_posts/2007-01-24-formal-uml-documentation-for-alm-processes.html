<blockquote>use cases can be deployed with good effect when implementing an enterprise scale Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) system.</blockquote>
I found this article from a pointer the CM forum at the <a href="http://www.xing.com/">Xing</a> networking site. Whilst I had considered the use of use cases before for process, I had not really thought about it a this level if granularity or the use of sequence diagrams to show higher level process. I might try some of this in my next Development Process engineering project.

Once obvious area of concern is that the products from such a UML effort will be too cumbersome to be useful and to hard to re-factor into more comprehensible documentation. Remember my mantra is "<a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/12/20/a-new-buzzword/">Appropriately Lightweight</a>"
