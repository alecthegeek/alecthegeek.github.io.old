I have no idea if this will work for everyone, but this is how I became a UNIX (and later Linux) geek:
<ol>
	<li>Read "<a title="Book home page" href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/upe/" target="_blank">The UNIX Programming Environment</a>", Ch 1-5 at least. An excellent introduction to the philosophy of UNIX as well as the basics of using it as a user and later a programmer.</li>
	<li>Get a copy of "<a title="Book home page" href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596003302" target="_blank">UNIX Power Tools</a>" as a desktop reference; however you aim to read it all.</li>
	<li>Make sure you have a network connected UNIX/Linux system on which you can lavish loving care and practice your new skills</li>
	<li>Keep reading books, manuals, articles, blogs, forums etc etc.</li>
</ol>
