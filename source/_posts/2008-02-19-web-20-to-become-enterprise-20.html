[slideshare id=115431&amp;doc=approaches-to-online-collaboration4038&amp;w=425]

A presentation from my chum <a href="http://carruthk.blogspot.com/2008/02/conference-presentation-on-social-media.html">Kate</a> on some of the new challenges facing organisations as Gen Y/Z comes on-board the workforce.

What I would like to see are some studies on how effective some of the new tools (Wikies, IM, "Project Centres" , Task Managers, etc) are in real life.

(Project Centres refers to tools like <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a>)
