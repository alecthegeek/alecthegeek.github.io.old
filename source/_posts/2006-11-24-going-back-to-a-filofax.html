For a number of years I used a <a href="http://www.filofax.com/int/" target="_blank">Filofax </a>as my diary and notebook, then I used a PDA with MS Outlook and embraced <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done/" target="_blank">GTD</a>, that worked very well. Since I migrated to Linux the PDA integration broke so I became all trendy and got myself a notebook and embraced <a href="http://utilware.com/gsd3.html" target="_blank">GSD</a>, which worked really well for 4 months.

However I now have a few problems:
<ul>
	<li>My daily task list and schedule has reached into the space for my project notes (which advances from the other end of the notebook)</li>
	<li>The scheduling does not work so well, as I <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/11/09/in-need-of-a-decent-calendar/" target="_blank">mentioned</a> a few weeks ago</li>
	<li>All my notes for current projects are stuck in my current notebook, which is a problem when I have to move active projects to a new notebook</li>
	<li>I have no space for addresses</li>
</ul>
My proposed solution is to resurrect my Filofax, but in a much simpler GSD style. It will have a diary (I will initially try one day per page for today's next actions lists etc.), an address section and then just lots of <a href="http://www.filofax.co.uk/images/products/refills/line/132216.gif" target="_blank">quadrille</a> paper for projects, designs, action lists, notes etc. Specialist options, for financial records for instance, are also possible. I will also try and use heavier paper this time, it makes a difference to writing.
