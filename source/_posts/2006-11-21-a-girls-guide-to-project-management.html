Thanks to <a href="http://katecarruthers.com/">Kate </a>I found <a href="http://www.pm4girls.co.uk/">A Girl's Guide to Project Management</a>, a blog by <font>Elizabeth Harrin, </font>which has some excellent resources. I look forward to trawling through the posts over the next few days. There are even some references to Australian material... :-).

On a separate note, do some women find it easier to be better project managers because they might have better developed social skills than many men? Or is that just sexist <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/claptrap" target="_blank">claptrap</a>?
