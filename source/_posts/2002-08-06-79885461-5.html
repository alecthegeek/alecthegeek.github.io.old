Both the kids are sick, Lisa with a cold and Jack with a dodgy tummy (or possibly a virus) so Marilyn will have them hone tomorrow.

Off to Sydney on Thus morning for a few hours. Customer needs help compiling a DLL to work with <a href="http://merant.com/PVCS/products/dimensions/">Dimensions</a>. Should a laugh.

I have also started a Free software project on <a href="http://sourceforge.org/">Sourceforge</a> for Software Engineering Requirments (it's called <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/requirefreedom">RequireFreedom</a> in a pathetic attempt to continue with cute project names!). Not a lot of activity so far as you can see.

As part of this I am also trying to get to grips with <a href="http://www.omg.org/gettingstarted/what_is_uml.htm">UML</a> and <a href="http://hillside.net/patterns/">OO</a> design Patterns. This is proving hard to do from books :-(
