I know I've <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2007/06/24/i-might-have-to-go-back-to-the-dark-side/">waffled</a> on about this before, but with 98% of the world running Windows it's becoming a pain in the posterior to be running a <a href="http://www.linux.org/">technically superior operating system</a>, especially with <a href="http://www.colinux.org/">coLinux </a>being such a great solution for those times when you need a proper platform (plus someone seems to have fixed the link to the Windows <a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/view/SVKWin32">port</a> of <a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/view/HomePage">svk</a>). As well as the issues relating to mobile device synchronisation etc. I often run into problems because evaluation software is only supplied for Windows.

I think by the end of the week I shall be in Windows land, with coLinux used for <a href="http://www.gnucash.org/">GnuCash</a> and Linux development. I'll use MS Outlook (supplied with my Smartphone) as a PIM and Windows OpenOffice. Of course I'll need to add a <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2002/08/07/79931489-4/">stack</a> of goodies to get something almost as good, things like a shell, a decent editor, a PDF driver, some development tools etc., etc.

Update -- well it appears that Optus/Samsung does not supply MS Outlook with their phone, so I might as well stay with Linux and Evolution with Windows under VMware
